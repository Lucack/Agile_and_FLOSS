Robust Automated Fiber Tracking: A Hybrid Software Architecture for Processing and Visualizing Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging Data,,Gompel S.V.; Schouten G.; Huijbers W.; Versluis M.,2023,5,Conference paper,10.1109/ICSA-C57050.2023.00027,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85159094059&doi=10.1109%2fICSA-C57050.2023.00027&partnerID=40&md5=8c41a2f0be726b7a42d34e64a6fa1c7f,diffusion MRI; fiber tracking; image processing; software architecture,"Robust Automated Fiber Tracking (RAFT) is a configurable software pipeline that automates extraction of fiber bundles from diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI) data. RAFT uses a hybrid software architecture design and is developed keeping the SOLID (Scalable, Operationally agile, Lean, IT focused and Delivers results) principles of software development in mind. This design is based on (i) the pipeline pattern: a software design pattern that provides the ability to execute a sequence of operations, (ii) while taking elements from a microservices architecture: a method to build server applications using a set of small self-contained services. Thanks to this hybrid architecture design, RAFT is a modular and open system allowing for easy modifications and future extensions. The resulting prototype fully automates the extraction process with many configuration options, while keeping the installation simple and usage of the system intuitive.  © 2023 IEEE.","Proceedings - IEEE 20th International Conference on Software Architecture Companion, ICSA-C 2023","20th IEEE International Conference on Software Architecture Companion, ICSA-C 2023",13 March 2023 through 17 March 2023,L�Aquila,188185,,0,Final,
Spray Flamelet Modeling of Turbulent Two-Phase Reacting Flows with Multi-Component Fuel in a Lean Direct Injection Combustor,,Yi R.; Chen C.P.,2023,,Article,10.1080/00102202.2023.2212319,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85159290317&doi=10.1080%2f00102202.2023.2212319&partnerID=40&md5=c35a7a9bd848d6dc48b30cc7e3058a18,lean direct injection combustor; multi-component surrogate fuel; multiple combustion regimes; preferential evaporation effect; Spray flamelet model,"Towards the numerical evaluation of the performance in aero-engine combustors, implementing detailed reaction kinetics into the large eddy simulation (LES) cost-effectively is highly desirable. In this work, a newly-developed spray flamelet model is combined with a four-component jet fuel surrogate model to allow integration of the detailed kinetics in the open-source CFD code. The spray flamelet approach (SFGM) can take into account the non-adiabatic effect caused by the evaporating spray and can directly reflect the preferential evaporation, as well as multiple combustion regimes present in complex spray combustion systems. The coupling of the SFGM-LES approach is assessed by comparison with the experimental data from a Lean Direct Injection (LDI) combustor, where the real aviation kerosene, Jet-A, was utilized. The SFGM-LES approach well predicts the experimental statistics in both gas and liquid phases. It is capable of capturing the rich physics and complex flame structures, including the preferential evaporation effect and the multi-regime combustion phenomenon. The present work demonstrates that the complex nature of multi-components and the multiple-combustion regimes in the two-phase combustion can be directly included in the spray flamelet approach, and thus this model can provide new insights into the turbulent spray combustion phenomena. © 2023 The Author(s).

A distinction is made between microfluidic lab-on-a-chip separation systems and portable small-scale separation systems. Unique benefits arise in the downsizing of conventional instrumentation, including significant decrease of reagent, sample, and energy consumption as well as faster, more cost-effective, and efficiently automated analytical processes. In the most advanced small-scale planar separation system, the chemical laboratory and biological laboratory were merged in a completely solvent-resistant miniaturized all-in-one 2LabsToGo system that is portable. It provided comparable results to those obtained by status-quo instrumentation and can be used for nontarget screening and effect-directed detection of complex samples. This makes test@home or Test2Go possible for interested citizens who want to check onsite product safety and exposure to complex samples themselves. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

And agile development, an efficient idea in software development, has been introduced into hardware. Furthermore, as a new hardware construction language, Chisel helps to raise the level of hardware design abstraction with the support of object-oriented and functional programming. Chisel plays a crucial role in future hardware design and open-source hardware development. However, the formal verification for Chisel is still limited. In this paper, we propose ChiselFV, a formal verification framework that has supported detailed formal hardware property descriptions and integrated mature formal hardware verification flows based on SymbiYosys. It builds on top of Chisel and uses Scala to drive the verification process. Thus the framework can be seen as an extension of Chisel. ChiselFV makes it easy to verify hardware designs formally when implementing them in Chisel. © 2023 EDAA.","Proceedings -Design, Automation and Test in Europe, DATE","2023 Design, Automation and Test in Europe Conference and Exhibition, DATE 2023",17 April 2023 through 19 April 2023,Antwerp,189131,"ACM Special Interest Group on Design Automation (SIGDA); European Design and Automation Association (EDA); IEEE Council on Electronic Design Automation (CEDA); SEMI, Electronic System Design (ESD) Alliance",0,Final,

It takes into account two processes, namely, infection and recovery/decease characterised by two parameters in total: contact rate and recovery/decease rate. Its solution has a form of a quasi-logistic function for which we have introduced an infection index that, should it become negative, can also be considered as a recovery/decease index with decrease of infected down to zero. Based on the data from open sources for the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic, seasonal influenza epidemics and a pandemic in the fauna world, a threshold value of the infection index has been shown to exist above which an infection expansion pretends to be considered as pandemic. Lean (two-parameter) SIR models affined with the warning SIS model have been built.

A number of studies of SE methodologies involve interviewing stakeholders to explore the real-world practice. Although these interview-based studies provide us with a user's perspective of an organization's practice, they do not describe the concrete summary of releases in open-source social coding platforms. In particular, no existing studies investigated how releases are evolved in open-source coding platforms, which assist release planners to a large extent. This study explores software development patterns followed in open-source projects to see the overall management's reflection on software release decisions rather than concentrating on a particular methodology. Our experiments on 51 software origins (with 1777k revisions and 12k releases) from the Software Heritage Graph Dataset (SWHGD) and their GitHub project boards (with 23k cards) reveal reasonably active project management with phase simplicity can release software versions more frequently and can follow the small release conventions of Extreme Programming. Additionally, the study also reveals that a combination of development and management activities can be applied to predict the possible number of software releases in a month ((Formula presented.)). © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Journal of Software: Evolution and Process,,,,,,0,Final,
A Low Cost PC-Based System for Clinical Information Management in Infant Neurodevelopment Services of Santiago de Cuba Province,,Cano-Ortiz S.D.; Lombardía-Legra L.; Deler-OFarril F.J.; Veranes-Bicet L.,2023,13,Conference paper,10.1007/978-3-031-17091-1_61,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85141667766&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-031-17091-1_61&partnerID=40&md5=80555b75aab9e5095dddf3d65c8f5021,Digital clinical history; e-Health applications; Neuro-development,"Childhood Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) collectively represent a great challenge for health systems internationally, with a significant economic and social impact. Despite the existence of digital devices in Cuban hospitals, the clinical records of patients are still written in hard format and stored in unfavourable conditions. Moreover the international market for Electronic Hospital Records systems (EHR’s) presents a wide variety of products but in addition to being expensive, they only prioritize clinical service. The main objective of this paper is to develop a low cost Web-based system oriented for research that automates the information management of the Services for Infant Neurodevelopment & Disability (SPNID) in Santiago de Cuba. The system was developed using open source tools and technologies, and the Extreme Programming as software development methodology. The ECR that responds to the services provided in the SPNID was developed in Visual Studio Code v1.39.2. The software has been implemented in the JavaScript programming language, using open source frameworks. Moreover a dedicated wireless network was designed for remote access of SPNID staff using mobile devices. The system was successfully evaluated in real conditions on the Intranet of the Southern Infant Hospital (HIS) by the SPNID specialists. Moreover a way of how to make the biomedical research about NDD closer to hospital was tackled by authors. The use of open source and the efficient use of low-cost solutions in the implemented system have proven to be viable alternatives for the improvement of health system in low-income countries like Cuba. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems,"19th International Conference on Remote Engineering and Virtual Instrumentation, REV 2022",28 February 2022 through 2 March 2022,Cairo,285299,,0,Final,

Numerical study of MILD Combustion of Ammonia/hydrogen Mixtures,,Cardona L.F.; Alvarado P.N.,2023,5,Article,10.3303/CET2398004,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85159621602&doi=10.3303%2fCET2398004&partnerID=40&md5=ddf6e4667a695186708b6a125b72c2cc,,"The combustion of ammonia (NH3) has sparked a renewed interest in the scientific community because it is a carbon-free fuel that does not contribute to global warming. Nevertheless, some of its disadvantages include the fact that (i) it has lower laminar flame speeds when compared to hydrocarbons, and (ii) that it is prone to the formation of nitride oxides (NOx) through the fuel route. As an alternative to address the first issue, it has been proposed to mix ammonia with hydrogen, but at the expense of even higher NOx emissions. Such emissions, however, can be reduced by operating at restrictive equivalence ratios near stoichiometry, which reduces oxygen availability in the reactions for NOx formation. This is a drawback because lean combustion, a technique that has been proven to reduce emissions for most fuels, is usually avoided in NH3 combustion. Therefore, with the goal of reducing NOx, this paper presents a numerical study using perfectly stirred reactors to investigate the potential use of both lean equivalence ratios and hydrogen enrichment in the MILD combustion of NH3. Some features of the MILD regime, such as low temperature increases due to reaction and the possibility of sustaining reactions under low oxygen concentrations, could be beneficial to ammonia combustion. Simulations were carried out in open-source software Cantera. According to the results, reaction can be sustained at lean equivalence ratios like 0.6 with a 50% hydrogen enrichment, and emissions of less than 100 ppm NO at 15% O2 on a dry basis can be obtained. In conclusion, MILD is a promising strategy for the clean burning of ammonia. Copyright © 2023, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.",Chemical Engineering Transactions,,,,,,0,Final,

The lack of in person communication and the incapability to share paper index cards among all meeting participants have a significant impact on project planning in distributed environments. This chapter discusses the benefits of Distributed Agile Software Development and the various distributed agile planning tools that are available to resolve these concerns. These tools differ in terms of features, operations, usage and pricing. This chapter aims at providing deeper insights into the most contemporary agile planning tools used by distributed agile professionals.

Numerical investigation of the effect of equivalence ratio on the propagation characteristics and performance of rotating detonation engine,,Chen H.; Si C.; Wu Y.; Hu H.; Zhu Y.,2023,,Article,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.03.190,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85151237296&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijhydene.2023.03.190&partnerID=40&md5=55c5f0876cc59b28d6e5d931844a055c,Discrete inlet; Equivalence ratio; Propagation mode; Rotating detonation wave; Specific impulse; Specific thrust,"The equivalence ratio is one of the significant factors affecting the propagation characteristics and performance of the rotating detonation engine (RDE). Using the compressible reacting flow solver based on the OpenFOAM open-source platform, the effect of different equivalence ratios of premixed H2/Air gases on the propagation characteristics and performance of RDE under different total inlet pressures (P0) is investigated. The reactants are injected through the discrete inlet to mimic the spatial inhomogeneity of the reactants in the actual RDE combustor. The results indicate a Y-shaped flow field structure is formed behind the rotating detonation wave (RDW) using the discrete inlet. There is only one RDW in the flow field with the change of the equivalence ratio when the P0 is 0.5 MPa, and the primary factors affecting the RDW propagation velocity differ under fuel-lean and fuel-rich conditions. The RDW propagation mode switches from single-wave to co-directional double-wave and double-wave collision with the change of the equivalence ratio when the P0 is 1.2 MPa. The velocity deficit of RDW in the double-wave mode is larger than that in the single-wave mode. Additionally, in the single-wave mode, the specific impulse decreases as the equivalence ratio increases, but the specific thrust increases as the equivalence ratio increases. When the propagation mode changes, the specific impulse and specific thrust show different trends with the change of the equivalence ratio. It demonstrates that multiple co-directional RDWs have the effect of stabilizing the thrust. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC",International Journal of Hydrogen Energy,,,,,,0,Article in press,
Best practices on adopting open-source and commercial low-cost devices in small satellites missions,,Di Roberto R.; Brandolini E.; Sparvieri G.; Graziani F.,2023,11,Article,10.1016/j.actaastro.2023.06.001,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85161479420&doi=10.1016%2fj.actaastro.2023.06.001&partnerID=40&md5=bec1d4b6a59fa432ae36111278a08a1f,COTS; CubeSat; OEM; Open-source; Raspberry; UNISAT,"The NewSpace approach of utilizing CubeSats and smaller satellites for complex LEO missions that once were reserved only for bigger platform, paired with the requirement of enduring reliability and quality assurance on batches of tens of satellites, is paving the way for the use of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components in micro-satellite missions. The recent global supply chain issues and extended lead times in the procurement of micro-controllers, memories and passive electronic components, caused by the pandemic and factories shutdowns, have resulted in a forced procurement diversification of several key elements, even in partially assembled products. GAUSS has been designing, manufacturing, and launching Small Satellites since early 2000. Its tenth satellite, UNISAT-7, was launched by a Soyuz-Fregat LV on March 22nd, 2021. Thanks to the vast experience gained on the application of commercial components in all the subsystems developed by the company, the typical overall costs for a complete platform are substantially lower compared to competitors, while retaining similar reliability. UNISAT-7, developed using lean-satellite methodologies, included more than 28 independent subsystems with their own telemetry, and most of them were developed in-house using ground COTS components; no space-grade products were employed, to save on overall mission costs. Some systems were devised from the start using open-source hardware, to expedite the prototyping process, while having the benefit of using readily available software, generally included with these platforms. Raspberry embedded devices were employed on the flight model for two remote sensing systems, to test how such systems, duly adapted to sustain space conditions, may perform and show reliability similar to commercial space systems worth thousand times the value. All systems have been activated and successfully verified for an entire year in LEO. They were hardened for vacuum, extreme temperatures, radiation, and launch stresses using common items found in general hardware stores. This work will delve into the open-source/COTS components used, the process employed to strengthen them, and the programmed flight firmware routines for maximizing embedded devices’ reliability in space. © 2023 IAA",Acta Astronautica,,,,,,0,Final,

However, this type of combustor is prone to experience trips due to lean blowout occurrences and combustion instability. Dynamic simulation is needed to investigate the system's behavior in mitigating the tripping problem. Therefore, this paper proposed a simulator of the DLE gas turbine using Raspberry Pi, which can be accessed through the local server. Rowen's model is modified to represent the DLE gas turbine system, and its physical model is developed using open-source software, namely Scilab/XCos. The model is then attached to a web-based interface developed using Python and HTML programming language. The deployment of the web-based interface enables the gas turbine model to be accessed remotely without caring about the device's location by connecting the mobile to the same Wi-Fi router.

CIDFuzz: Fuzz testing for continuous integration,,Zhang J.; Cui Z.; Chen X.; Yang H.; Zheng L.; Liu J.,2023,14,Article,10.1049/sfw2.12125,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85152028661&doi=10.1049%2fsfw2.12125&partnerID=40&md5=d6c5ee04a233deade6994e63aa29f3ce,program testing; quality assurance; software quality,"As agile software development and extreme programing have become increasingly popular, continuous integration (CI) has become a widely used collaborative work method. However, it is common to make changes frequently to a project during CI. If existing testing methods are applied to CI directly, it will be difficult to make testing resources focus on changes generated by CI, which results in insufficient testing for changes. To solve this problem, we propose a fuzz testing method for CI. First, differential analysis is performed to determine the change points generated during CI, change points are added to the taint source set, and static analysis is conducted to calculate the distances between each basic block and the taint sources. Then, the project under test is instrumented according to the distances. During fuzz testing, testing resources are allocated based on seed coverage to test the change points effectively. Using the proposed methods, we implement CIDFuzz as a prototype tool, and experiments are conducted on four open-source projects that use CI. Experimental results show that, compared with AFL and AFLGo, CIDFuzz can reduce the time costs of covering change points up to 39.59% and 41.64%, respectively. Also, CIDFuzz can reduce the time costs of reproducing vulnerabilities up to 34.78% and 25.55%. © 2023 The Authors.

It becomes even more tedious and complex task when the development shifts to usage of Agile tools and techniques. As the methodologies and issues managed in the Agile Software Development (ASD) framework are absolutely poles apart from conventional software development quality assurance architecture and testing phenomenal. In ASD a concentration on people is more focused than processes and methods. Moreover an ASD Test plan is energetic throughout the development process resulting in a high quality product through rigorous feedback and analysis. ASD test plans are written after every phase and release of software where load and performance testing is one of the key elements. The fourth quadrant of the Agile testing (load and performance testing) concentrates on the non-functional requirements such as performance, security and stability. Apache’s open source testing tool – JMeter – has been used for quality improvement of open source software for Load testing. It is a java based application used to analyze the performance of software, application and web pages with feature of reliable IDE and Test Plan Recording. Moreover it is capable enough to manage with both Load and Performance Testing techniques for static and dynamic resources. This is made possible by simulating thousands of users to the target server or host software and responses in the form of statistics and graphical formats. The results generated in the chapter revealed that performance testing is efficiently performed by JMeter for quality enhancement over the open source software. © 2023 Scrivener Publishing LLC.","Agile Software Development: Trends, Challenges and Applications",,,,,,0,Final,

However, such velocity does not allow predicting when the product will be finished. Story points measure effort only. They do not discriminate between creating functionality and other tasks. Non-functional requirements, such as agreeing with stakeholders, designing, testing, or documenting, consume effort but do not add functionality. Thus, it remains unclear whether the product makes any progress, or the team is just looping around technical debt and unclear requirements. Euro Project Office has therefore developed a method how to complement a product backlog by functional size, indicating progress and completeness in unambiguous terms. The method is based on the international standard ISO/IEC 14143 [1] and ISO/IEC 19761 [2]. Tools are available as open source and can be used by development teams with minimum investment into training. Aim of This Tutorial: This tutorial teaches participants how to set up a model of the software under development according to ISO/IEC 19761, using an open-source Excel-based tool, and how to measure function size during several sprints. Participants are expected to have experience with agile software development but need no previous knowledge of the standards mentioned above.  © 2023 ACM.",ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,"27th International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering, EASE 2023",14 June 2023 through 16 June 2023,Oulu,189102,,0,Final,

Most of these training modules simplify the development environment, for example, by using LEGO bricks or playing cards. This oversimplification has been shown to result in limited transferability of learning to industrial practice. Furthermore, there is a lack of teaching modules that specifically address the challenges of applying Agile to physical products. In this paper, we present an open-source educational game that realistically simulates a hardware development project to teach Agile principles. Over 2 days, participants design, manufacture, and test modifications for a physical wire bending machine within an authentic engineering and production setting. The training mimics the typical roles, processes, and tools of industrial engineering teams to reflect the challenges of Agile hardware development. The module was evaluated with 44 industry professionals regarding perceived learning and user reaction. A combination of quantitative and qualitative methods was used for the experimental evaluation. The results showed a positive learning effect as the participants' average agreement with Agile principles increased through the training. Concerning user reaction, respondents reported a high degree of relevance, interaction, and confidence, indicating that the realistic simulation of the hardware development appropriately balanced the degree of realism with simplicity. The study showcases the opportunities of properly aligning game components to provoke learning situations targeted by the instructors. It contributes to the extant literature by providing a design framework (product, process, setting, and instruction) and open-source access to the tools used for implementation. © 2023 The Authors.

High-end applications rely on power-hungry Systems-on-Chip (SoCs) featuring powerful processors, large LPDDR/DDR3/4/5 memories, and supporting full-fledged Operating Systems (OS). On the contrary, low-end applications typically rely on Ultra-Low-Power μcontrollers with a 'close to metal' software en-vironment and simple micro-kernel-based runtimes. Emerging applications and trends of IoT require the 'best of both worlds': cheap and low-power SoC systems with a well-known and agile software environment based on full-fledged OS (e.g., Linux), coupled with extreme energy efficiency and parallel digital signal processing capabilities. We present HULK-V: an open-source Heterogeneous Linux-capable RISC-V-based SoC coupling a 64-bit RISC-V processor with an 8-core Programmable Multi-Core Accelerator (PMCA), delivering up to 13.8 GOps, up to 157 GOps/W and accelerating the execution of complex DSP and ML tasks by up to 112× over the host processor. HULK-V leverages a lightweight, fully digital memory hierarchy based on HyperRAM IoT DRAM that exposes up to 512 MB of DRAM memory to the host CPU.

Quantitative diagnostic parameters are typically calculated based on contours or points provided by readers, e.g. natural intelligences (NI) such as clinicians or researchers, and artificial intelligences (AI). As clinical applications multiply, evaluating the precision and reproducibility of quantitative parameters becomes increasingly important. Although segmentation challenges for AIs and guidelines for clinicians provide quality assessments and regulation, the methods ought to be combined and streamlined for clinical applications. The goal of the developed software, Lazy Luna (LL), is to offer a flexible evaluation tool that is readily extendible to new sequences and scientific endeavours. Methods: An interface was designed for LL, which allows for comparing annotated CMR images. Geometric objects ensure precise calculations of metric values and clinical results regardless of whether annotations originate from AIs or NIs. A graphical user interface (GUI) is provided to make the software available to non-programmers. The GUI allows for an interactive inspection of image datasets as well as implementing tracing procedures, which follow statistical reader differences in clinical results to their origins in individual image contours. The backend software builds on a set of meta-classes, which can be extended to new imaging sequences and clinical parameters. Following an agile development procedure with clinical feedback allows for a quick implementation of new classes, figures and tables for evaluation. Results: Two application cases present LL's extendibility to clinical evaluation and AI development contexts. The first concerns T1 parametric mapping images segmented by two expert readers. Quantitative result differences are traced to reveal typical segmentation dissimilarities from which these differences originate. The meta-classes are extended to this new application scenario. The second applies to the open source Late Gadolinium Enhancement (LGE) quantification challenge for AI developers “Emidec”, which illustrates LL's usability as open source software. Conclusion: The presented software Lazy Luna allows for an automated multilevel comparison of readers as well as identifying qualitative reasons for statistical reader differences. The open source software LL can be extended to new application cases in the future. © 2023",Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine,,,,,,0,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access

With the growth of integration system, running all tests to verify the quality of submitted code, is clearly uneconomical. This paper aims at selecting a proper test subset towards full coverage of all changed and affected code so as to reduce the cost of CI testing. We proposes FEST, a novel approach, which searches for the full dependencies of changed code at the class level and then selects test classes related to the changed and affected classes. We assess FEST from fault detection efficiency and cost effectiveness based on 18 open source projects with 261 continuous integration versions from Eclipse and Apache communities, and compare it with the state-of-the-art approach ClassSRTS (as baseline). Results show that FEST (1) can not only cover all faults detected by actual CI testing and baseline, but also find new faults in 25% and 18% versions respectively. (2) shows better or equal test scale benefits than actual CI testing (in 98% versions) and baseline (in 99% versions); and can compensate risk of omitting necessary tests for actual CI testing (in 62% versions) and baseline (in 73% versions). © 2019 Knowledge Systems Institute Graduate School.

This extends to the current pedagogy for teaching systems analysis and design (SA&D). However, overemphasizing agile and DevOps neglects broader dimensions that are essential for planning and executing enterprise-level systems projects. Thus, a dilemma may arise: do we teach agile and DevOps techniques that may be inadequate for enterprise-level projects or do we teach the wider range of plan-driven skills and techniques that may conflict with the tenets and benefits of agile and DevOps? In this paper, we advocate for resolving this dilemma by adopting a generalized process framework that both fully supports enterprise-level projects but can also be selectively scaled back toward increased agility for smaller, less complex projects. In its full realization, this framework combines extensive project planning and up-front requirements with iterative delivery - an increasingly popular approach today for enterprise projects. In scaling back toward agile, the framework carefully accounts for system, environment, and team characteristics. Further, the model emphasizes issues frequently underemphasized by agile approaches, including the use of external software such as commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS), Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), and open source products and components; the need for business-oriented project planning and justification; and support for change management to ensure successful system adoption. The framework thereby flexibly accommodates the full range of activities that software projects must support to be successful. © 2019 by the Information Systems & Computing Academic Professionals, Inc.",Journal of Information Systems Education,,,,,,3,Final,
A numerical investigation on the thermo-chemical structures of methane-oxygen diffusion flame-streets in a microchannel,,Kang X.; Sun B.; Wang J.; Wang Y.,2019,15,Article,10.1016/j.combustflame.2019.05.006,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85065602980&doi=10.1016%2fj.combustflame.2019.05.006&partnerID=40&md5=6d725293e4b8109f81b7702a81a6a3c4,Diffusion flame; Edge flame; Flame-street; Micro-combustion; Numerical simulation,"“Flame-street” refers to the interesting combustion phenomenon that a diffusion flame in a narrow channel is separated into a discrete series of flame segments. Although flame-street has been observed experimentally for more than a decade, numerical simulations of this phenomenon with realistic chemistry and detailed analysis of its thermo-chemical structures have yet to be performed. In this paper, the methane-oxygen diffusion flame-street observed by Misse et al. (2005) [36] in a microchannel was numerically reproduced using a reacting flow solver developed based on the open-source framework OpenFOAM. The main purpose of the present work is to investigate the detailed thermo-chemical structures of diffusion flame-street in the anticipation of a deep understanding of the underlying mechanisms responsible for its formation. Our simulation results show that the presence of discrete flame segments can strongly affect the flow field. In addition, the flame-street was found to consist of a bibrachial leading flame with a long diffusion tail and a much weaker fuel-lean premixed branch, and consecutive downstream “new moon”-like flamelets each with a fuel-lean and a fuel-rich premixed branch. Chemical structures of these flame branches were analyzed by examining critical reactions that contribute significantly to the overall heat release. Finally, the effects of channel wall thermal conditions and species mass diffusion on the formation of the flame-street were investigated. It was found that the flame street could be established only at a moderate level of heat loss to the wall: significantly enhanced or reduced heat losses would result in either a single short edge flame or a long continuous edge flame. Increased mass diffusivity was seen to enhance combustion, elongate the leading flame, and even lead to more flame segments that appeared within the channel, although they may exist in a unsteady mode, being repetitively split, moving downstream and being blown-out/extinguished. © 2019 The Combustion Institute",Combustion and Flame,,,,,,18,Final,

However, such a migration should be carefully performed due to the cloud's public nature. Further, due to the agile development cycle that applications follow, their security level might not be the best possible, exhibiting various sorts of vulnerability. As such, to better support application migration and runtime provisioning, this article supplies three main contributions. First, it attempts to connect vulnerability management to the application lifecycle so as to highlight the exact moments where application vulnerability assessment must be performed. Second, it analyses the state-of-the-art open-source tools and databases so as to enable developers to make an informed decision about which ones to select. In this sense, discovering such vulnerabilities will enable to better secure applications before or after migrating them to the cloud. The analysis conducted is quite rich, covering various aspects and a rich sets of criteria. Third, it explores the claim that vulnerability scanning tools need to be orchestrated to reach the highest possible vulnerability coverage, both in terms of extend and breadth. Finally, this article concludes with some challenges that current vulnerability tools and databases need to face to increase their added-value and applicability level. © 2019 The Authors",Array,,,,,,22,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access

Increasing competition and rapidly changing market needs require from nowadays companies' flexibility and fast time to market of their products. To achieve these goals more and more organizations are relying on new IT technologies and software development processes. Though there are many publications around DevOps as a methodology and the use of a process for continuous integration and continuous development, there are fewer solutions provided which incorporate a software delivery pipeline incorporating all processes: continuous business planning, agile development, continuous integration, continuous deployment and continuous testing. The paper proposes a DevOps architecture and agile tools to be used in the implementation of a fully integrated DevOps pipeline based on open-source.

Open source health information systems (HIS) such as OpenMRS and Care2X are increasingly adopted in resource constrained countries including Tanzania. The exchange of patients’ information in terms of electronic medical records (EMR) between different types of HIS is challenged by the heterogeneity. This brings challenges in integrating medical data and also interoperability of the e-medical recording systems became complicated. In this study, we proposed a medical records exchange system (MRES) prototype for exchange of information on OpenMRS and Care2x hospital information systems. The software development was done using Agile methodology and implemented in a web-based application framework that allowed for ease of integration and use of health information systems at medical facilities. The MRES allows for exchange of medical information when patients are transferred from one hospital to another overcoming the queues and paper work involved in the process. © 2019, Accent Social and Welfare Society.

However, this approach is unfit for the more software-intensive world that is increasingly iterative, connected, and constantly online. Many constraints prevent the application of iterative, incremental, and agile development methodologies, which now are the norm for many other fields of software. Time-consuming system validation can only start when both hardware and software components are ready, which implies that the software delivery and quality is almost always the final bottleneck in the CPS development and integration. Also organizational issues raise concerns-CPS development teams are nowadays often geographically distributed, which can result in delays in the process, shortcomings, and even mistakes.

Apart from overpressure its often important to know the maximum deflections of the enclosures to examine the structural integrity. The container walls are not rigid; they not only contribute through acoustic response to the pressure waves but also through structural resonance response to the generated overpressures, to capture these effects its necessary to do the Fluid Structure Interaction (FSI) or in simple terms the coupled Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Finite element analysis (FE) simulations. Alternatively, the structural response can be coupled to CFD simulation in either one-way or two-way interactions to reduce the associated computation efforts. Numerical simulations have been conducted with a pseudo two-way coupled CFD & FSI, to aid our understanding of the combination of various factor contributing for the generation of overpressures using an in-house solver developed based on open source CFD code OpenFOAM named as HyFOAM. The CFD solver solves the compressible Navier-stokes equations along with the spring-mass-damper system's single degree of freedom motion equation for coupled fluid structure interactions. The turbulent flame deflagrations are modelled using the flame area combustion model, the necessary modification are incorporated to governing equations to include the dominant flame instabilities present during the vented deflagration process. For lean hydrogen mixtures the Lewis number effects are important hence suitable modelling improvements are added to the combustion model. The numerical results are validated against the recent experiments conducted at Gexcon, Norway as part of the HySEA project supported by the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen 2 Joint Undertaking (FCHJU) under the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research and Innovation.

They involve software artefacts, which are managed and deployed as composite services using DevOps principles. Those softwarized networks rely on complex technology stacks, starting with low-level virtualization technologies and ranging up to machine-learning-based orchestration solutions. One of the main challenges in those environments is to verify that the deployed functions and services operate correctly and meet the quality goals set by the stakeholders before they are put into production. We tackle this challenge by introducing the novel concept of a verification and validation (V&V) platform for NFV, which enables automatic testing and qualification of single network functions and complex services. By adding such a platform to the NFV ecosystem, new business models emerge, as we discuss in this article. We evaluate our proposed concepts by presenting a case study that uses our open source V&V platform to verify and validate the behavior and performance of a real-world network service. © 1979-2012 IEEE.",IEEE Communications Magazine,,,,,,25,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access

However, attaining robust security assurance while delivering features requires a precarious balancing act in the context of agile development practices. One path forward to help aid development teams in securing their software products is through the design and development of security-focused automation. Ergo, we present a novel approach, called SecureReqNet, for automatically identifying whether issues in software issue tracking systems describe security-related content. Our approach consists of a two-phase neural net architecture that operates purely on the natural language descriptions of issues. The first phase of our approach learns high dimensional word embeddings from hundreds of thousands of vulnerability descriptions listed in the CVE database and issue descriptions extracted from open source projects. The second phase then utilizes the semantic ontology represented by these embeddings to train a convolutional neural network capable of predicting whether a given issue is security-related. We evaluated SecureReqNet by applying it to identify security-related issues from a dataset of thousands of issues mined from popular projects on GitLab and GitHub. In addition, we also applied our approach to identify security-related requirements from a commercial software project developed by a major telecommunication company. Our preliminary results are encouraging, with SecureReqNet achieving an accuracy of 96% on open source issues and 71.6% on industrial requirements. © 2019 IEEE.","Proceedings - 2019 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution, ICSME 2019","2019 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution, ICSME 2019",30 September 2019 through 4 October 2019,Cleveland,155692,,15,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access

But in reality, many responses contribute to the quality of software developed which requires to be studied simultaneously. This paper attempts to study the number of defects in software and the effort required in correcting these defects, simultaneously using desirability function and Taguchi method. Effort is defined as the time span from when the defect was logged into the system to the time when the defect was corrected and removed from the system and is measured in hours. The work has been executed on the issue tracking system of a large telecommunication organization. The organization manufactured consumer electronic devices having embedded software developed using agile development method. The input factors studied are Change Request Priority, software development phase and severity, which were selected from a total of 24 parameters using analytic hierarchy process.

However, the difficulty inherent to their development process, which can be seen as a software composition issue, is the lack of structured approach and a teachable methodology for efficiently tackling such project. In this paper, we propose a 5-step pedagogical OSF’s customization approach, coupled with an agile development process to guide the learner and ease his comprehension. We experience this approach to prototype WiAFirm, an OpenWRT-based firmware for operating IEEE 802.11x enabled WAP. Two groups of 04 students each were involved. After 2 months of experimentation, the group that applied the approach was able to integrate into the core OpenWRT a custom WifiDog captive portal feature as a built-in package; while the other group had barely understood the goal of customizing an OSF. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,"Computing Conference, 2019",16 July 2019 through 17 July 2019,London,228089,,0,Final,

CLOBNET enables comprehensive analysis and visualization of structured EHR data. We demonstrate the utility of CLOBNET by predicting primary therapy outcomes of patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) on the basis of EHR data. MATERIALS AND METHODS CLOBNET is built using open-source software to make data preprocessing, analysis, and model training user friendly. The source code of CLOBNET is available in GitHub. The HGSOC data set was based on a prospective cohort of 208 patients with HGSOC who were treated at Turku University Hospital, Finland, from 2009 to 2019 for whom comprehensive clinical and EHR data were available. RESULTS We trained machine learning (ML) models using clinical data, including a herein developed dissemination score that quantifies the disease burden at the time of diagnosis, to identify patients with progressive disease (PD) or a complete response (CR) on the basis of RECIST (version 1.1). The best performance was achieved with a logistic regression model, which resulted in an area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.86, with a specificity of 73% and a sensitivity of 89%, when it classified between patients who experienced PD and CR. CONCLUSION We have developed an open-source computational infrastructure, CLOBNET, that enables effective and rapid analysis of EHR and other clinical data. Our results demonstrate that CLOBNET allows predictions to be made on the basis of EHR data to address clinically relevant questions. © 2019 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",JCO Clinical Cancer Informatics,,,,,,6,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access

However, building innovative products is becoming gradually more challenging because of increased market volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity. In our Innovation Lab, inside an e-Procurement Company, we encountered several challenges when implementing an innovation process to develop an initial unstructured data processing Minimum Viable Product (MVP) based on opensource big data tools: (i) raising and prioritizing user demands; (ii) deciding about adequate tools; and (iii) understanding how to promptly set up a viable product. In this paper, we share our open-source innovation experience in bringing novel solutions to an oil company's suppliers. In general, we present and discuss how we have been applying our innovation process to create MVPs, and which technical decision helped us accelerate the MVP development in the presence of a large-scale, unstructured database and open-source big data tools.

The opportunity is the availability of powerful ICT technologies, that everyone uses every day with smart phones thanks to the well-established and expensive infrastructure provided by tech giants. The necessity is the achievement of Lean transformation in western enterprises through a deep knowledge on manufacturing processes and an incessant training of workforce. Industry 4.0 will provide us with an integrated holistic view of the manufacturing processes and the possibility to control them according to appropriate forecasts and evaluation of performances and results. Industry 4.0 was born in 2011 and it is in its early stage, there are many research gaps which must be studied and large applications that must be fully integrated in the Industry 4.0 framework. In this paper a simple application of Industry 4.0 is presented with the aim of demonstrating that, using commercially available open source components, it is possible to integrate different technologies belonging to industry (robotics) and commercial components into one eco-system. Moreover, it integrates different I4.0 enabling technologies namely: Robotics, IoT and fog/edge computing.

These conditions have limited the development of open-sourced chip design to some extent. To further reduce the threshold for chip development, research teams at University of California, Berkeley have designed the open ISA RISC-V. They also open-sourced the Rocket Chip project, the SoC implementation of RISC-V, and put forward Chisel, a new hardware construction language, for agile development. How do RISC-V, Rocket Chip and Chisel enable open-source chip agile development? With some case studies during the development of the Labeled RISC-V project led by the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, this article shows: 1) An open and active ISA ecosystem (such as RISC-V) is a necessary condition to promote chip innovation; 2) Chisel's features such as bulk connection, metaprogramming, object-oriented programming, and functional programming, can greatly reduce the amount of code and improve code maintainability; 3) Agile development can achieve an order of magnitude improvement in coding efficiency, while achieving comparable or even better performance, power consumption and area overhead than traditional hardware development models. © 2019, Science Press.

Among many other processes, they allow users to perform advanced processes (e.g. Mastering and Equalization) on audio files and apply a chains of audio effects (e.g. Gain, reverb) using sophisticated GUI. DAWs has proven to be a useful resource for Digital Signal Processing (DSP) tasks, and in particular for music production. While the tools are powerful and stable, utilizing tools that require a certain level of knowledge and background in music production and sound processing can be messy and error prone. We propose a solution that allows batch processing of audio file in a fast and prompt manner carrying out some of the popular digital signal processing techniques. The proposed solution, py DAW, is in the form of an open-source tool for users who cannot afford using DAWs for their cost or complexity. pyDAW is a lean Python Command Line Interface (CLI) that provides a simple interface to complement regular DAWs GUI environments, making it easier to run DAWs functionalities in a batch and simple manner. © 2019 IEEE.",Proceedings - ICCES 2019: 2019 14th International Conference on Computer Engineering and Systems,"14th International Conference on Computer Engineering and Systems, ICCES 2019",17 December 2019,Cairo,159305,Ain Shams University (ASU); IEEE Egypt Section,0,Final,

An operator has constructed an agile program for drilling data analytics to lead the development of analytics solutions, deployment to collect business values, and handover to productization. The product under development is a Real-Time Drilling Advisor (RTDA) Appstore, which is both an R&D template for prototyping and a hosting environment for rapid field trials and early deployments. The RTDA Appstore consists of a witsml data pipeline, template of drilling data analytics functionalities, modularized computational kernels, machine learning packages for historical data analysis, an in-memory database for both historical and real-time processed data, customized drilling visualization widgets, and an open-source web app deployment framework. A hybrid methodology combining conventional engineering practice, data-driven approaches, novel visualization formats, and physics-based modeling is adopted to develop real-time data analytics solutions. It focuses on three areas: failure detection, performance improvement, and advisory directional drilling. A list of applications and features in the RTDA Appstore includes: interactive offset data map, drilling parameter roadmap, drilling efficiency monitoring, bit/reamer wear prediction, smart torque/drag, payzone tracking, auto slide sheets, sliding KPI, real-time casing wear, real-time BIC benchmarking, etc. So far, about 30 wells of the company's Deepwater wells and about 150 of the company's unconventional wells were drilled using RTDA applications. RTDA deployments generated time and cost savings through early warnings or bespoke visualization of information for improved decision making. The RTDA Appstore is built in-house and thus provides flexibility and modularization options and heavily focused on the analytics layer. The agile program creates an interactive channel to not only meet business demand, but also to use feedback from operations to steer the digital R&D strategy. As the half open-source nature of this program, the digital capability cultivated through the development and deployment of RTDA will also be cascaded to local wells teams through format of digital training, code repository, and a single portal Appstore.

In this paper, the analysis is started by identifying return instructions to disassemble binary code. The return instruction identification problem is converted into a binary classification problem: is a byte in binary code the first byte of a return instruction? The 32 bytes around a byte in binary code are considered the feature of the byte. A multilayer perceptron is employed to build the classification model. Then, the model is trained with 1,383 binaries from Windows XP SP3.

In addition, they may have some basic knowledge of databases and web technologies. Moreover, in our curriculum, students at this level have not been exposed to any codebase of real-world application and particularly of large size (>10,000 lines) codebases yet. Based on such situations, the major focus of this course is on teaching the fundamentals of software engineering as a methodology of developing real-world software with an emphasis on: 1) software systems in the enterprise level, 2) basic modeling using functional, flow, and behavioral diagrams, and 3) team-based agile project development.

We will first analyze what the role of a software engineer was in the past. We will examine limitations associated with software development life cycle models, and software failures that catalyzed increased importance for quality assurance. We then outline the current role of a software engineer. We discuss the impact of agile software development and automation on the software development cycle, the influence of open source software and how new technologies such as Function-as-a-Service and machine learning may impacted the role. Based on our research, we analyze why the software engineer role has changed and postulate prospective changes to the role of software engineer, and in particular how new responsibilities may affect the day to day work of future software engineers.

Effective collaboration within software teams has become crucial for building successful products. In this context, harnessing the data available in online code hosting facilities can help towards understanding how teams work and optimizing the development process. Although there are several approaches that mine contributions' data, they usually view contributors as a uniform body of engineers, and focus mainly on the aspect of productivity while neglecting the quality of the work performed. In this work, we design a methodology for identifying engineer roles in development teams and determine the behaviors that prevail for each role. Using a dataset of GitHub projects, we perform clustering against the DevOps axis, thus identifying three roles: developers that are mainly preoccupied with code commits, operations engineers that focus on task assignment and acceptance testing, and the lately popular role of DevOps engineers that are a mix of both. Our analysis further extracts behavioral patterns for each role, this way assisting team leaders in knowing their team and effectively directing responsibilities to achieve optimal workload balancing and task allocation.

Companies such as Microsoft have invested in in-house infrastructures with the goal of optimizing the build process. CloudBuild, a distributed and caching build service developed internally by Microsoft, runs the build process in parallel in the cloud and relies on caching to accelerate builds. This allows for agile development and rapid delivery of software even several times a day. However, moving towards faster builds requires not only improvements on the infrastructure side, but also attention to developers' changes in the software. Surely, architectural decisions and software changes, such as addition of dependencies, can lead to significant build time increase. Yet, estimating the impact of such changes on build time can be challenging when dealing with complex, distributed, and cached build systems. In this paper, we envision a predictive model able to preemptively alert developers on the extent to which their software changes may impact future building activities. In particular, we describe an approach that analyzes the developer's change and predicts (i) whether it impacts (any of) the Longest Critical Path; (ii) may lead to build time increase and its delta; and (iii) the percentage of future builds that might be affected by such change. © 2019 IEEE.","Proceedings - 2019 IEEE/ACM 41st International Conference on Software Engineering: New Ideas and Emerging Results, ICSE-NIER 2019","41st IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering: New Ideas and Emerging Results, ICSE-NIER 2019",25 May 2019 through 31 May 2019,Montreal,151074,Association for Computing Machinery (ACM); et al.; IEEE Computer Society; National Science Foundation (NSF); Special Interest Group on Software Engineering (SIGSOFT); Technical Council on Software Engineering (TCSE),9,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access

At the same time, many software organizations are applying Scrum software development practices, for productivity and quality gains. Scrum calls for self-organizing teams, in which the development team has total control over its development process. However, OSS projects typically have their own processes and standards, which might not mesh well with a company's internal processes, such as Scrum. This paper presents an experience report from Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE), where the 'toolchain CPU compiler' team directly participates in the 'LLVM' OSS project. The team ran into a number of difficulties when using Scrum to manage their development. In particular, the team often failed to complete Scrum sprints where tasks required interaction with the open source community. We look at how the team redefined task flows to alleviate these difficulties, and eventually evolved a highly modified process, dubbed TWINS (This Workflow Is Not Scrum). We assess the revised process, and compare it to other established agile methods, finding it bears a strong resemblance to Scrumban (the SIE team was not aware of Scrumban previously). The TWINS framework presented here may help other organizations who develop software in-house and engage in OSS projects, to gain the best of both worlds. © 2019 IEEE.","Proceedings - 2019 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software and System Processes, ICSSP 2019","2019 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software and System Processes, ICSSP 2019",25 May 2019,Montreal,151276,Association for Computing Machinery (ACM); International Software and Systems Process Association (ISSPA); Special Interest Group on Software Engineering (SIGSOFT); Technical Council on Software Engineering (TCSE),7,Final,

In this paper, we detail how the operations team responded to several challenges such as the reduction in personnel after the Launch and Early Orbit Operations phase, the addition of a downlink antenna in Japan, high-fidelity collection requests during the unusually active 2017 Atlantic hurricane season, and the increased demands of team members from other projects. These pressures forced the CYGNSS operations team to innovate their way to efficient operations. These innovations were enabled by embracing modern open-source tools such as Django, Bokeh, Git, the various libraries available in the Python programming language, and the capabilities that come with all of our operations engineers being competent in software development. The CYGNSS team took the approach of automating the most time-intensive tasks first, which freed up time to carefully design and test more elaborate automation solutions. We utilized the spirit of the Agile Methodology to make incremental improvements to our software suite which further enabled more sophisticated automation. Finally, we chart a path forward to fully closing the automation loop between our mission planning, and real-time Command and Control. © 2019 IEEE.",IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings,"2019 IEEE Aerospace Conference, AERO 2019",2 March 2019 through 9 March 2019,Big Sky,148873,,1,Final,

However, with a market dominated by two or three industrial players and a lack of open-source hardware realizations and standardized GPU Instruction-Set Architectures (ISAs), the full potential of these architectures for academic research and use by small hardware development enterprises remains far from being unlocked. In this paper, we start by discussing a few exciting research directions in GPGPU architectures and the benefits of open-source Hardware realizations. Furthermore, we show how our open-source FGPU core can be used to enable overcoming these challenges and contribute to the agile development of Domain-Specific Architectures (DSAs) featuring System-on-Chip (SoC) platforms extended with adapted GPGPU cores.

The numerous recent Hardware Construction Languages such as Chisel are providing enhanced ways to design complex hardware architectures with notable academic and industrial successes. While the latter environments are now mature and perfectly suited for brand new projects, migrating partially or entirely existing Verilog code-base proves to be a challenging and very time-consuming process. Successful migrations need to be able to leverage finely tuned existing hardware descriptions as a basis to build complex systems through simple iterations. This article introduces sv2chisel, an open-source automated (System)Verilog to Chisel translator as entry point for this iterative migration processes.

A feature location approach for mapping application features extracted from crowd-based screencasts to source code,,Moslehi P.; Adams B.; Rilling J.,2020,53,Article,10.1007/s10664-020-09874-z,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85091106536&doi=10.1007%2fs10664-020-09874-z&partnerID=40&md5=57269558085384b315b623186c1e643f,Crowd-based documentation; Feature location; Information extraction; Mining video content; Software documentation; Software traceability; Speech analysis,"Crowd-based multimedia documents such as screencasts have emerged as a source for documenting requirements, the workflow and implementation issues of open source and agile software projects. For example, users can show and narrate how they manipulate an application’s GUI to perform a certain functionality, or a bug reporter could visually explain how to trigger a bug or a security vulnerability. Unfortunately, the streaming nature of programming screencasts and their binary format limit how developers can interact with a screencast’s content. In this research, we present an automated approach for mining and linking the multimedia content found in screencasts to their relevant software artifacts and, more specifically, to source code. We apply LDA-based mining approaches that take as input a set of screencast artifacts, such as GUI text and spoken word, to make the screencast content accessible and searchable to users and to link it to their relevant source code artifacts. To evaluate the applicability of our approach, we report on results from case studies that we conducted on existing WordPress and Mozilla Firefox screencasts. We found that our automated approach can significantly speed up the feature location process. For WordPress, we find that our approach using screencast speech and GUI text can successfully link relevant source code files within the top 10 hits of the result set with median Reciprocal Rank (RR) of 50% (rank 2) and 100% (rank 1). In the case of Firefox, our approach can identify relevant source code directories within the top 100 hits using screencast speech and GUI text with the median RR = 20%, meaning that the first true positive is ranked 5 or higher in more than 50% of the cases. Also, source code related to the frontend implementation that handles high-level or GUI-related aspects of an application is located with higher accuracy. We also found that term frequency rebalancing can further improve the linking results when using less noisy scenarios or locating less technical implementation of scenarios. Investigating the results of using original and weighted screencast data sources (speech, GUI, speech and GUI) that can result in having the highest median RR values in both case studies shows that speech data is an important information source that can result in having RR of 100%. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Empirical Software Engineering,,,,,,1,Final,

Due to the large problem size and many-body simulation problem in the chemical stage, existing CPU-based computational packages encounter the problem of low computational efficiency. This paper reports our development on a GPU-based microscopic Monte Carlo simulation tool gMicroMC using advanced GPU-acceleration techniques. Methods: gMicroMC simulated electron transport in the physical stage using an interaction-by-interaction scheme to calculate the initial events generating radicals in water. After the physicochemical stage, initial positions of all radicals were determined. Simulation of radicals’ diffusion and reactions in the chemical stage was achieved using a step-by-step model using GPU-accelerated parallelization together with a GPU-enabled box-sorting algorithm to reduce the computations of searching for interaction pairs and therefore improve efficiency. A multi-scale DNA model of the whole lymphocyte cell nucleus containing ~6.2 Gbp of DNA was built. Results: Accuracy of physical stage simulation was demonstrated by computing stopping power and track length. The results agreed with published data and the data produced by GEANT4-DNA (version 10.3.3) simulations with 10 -20% difference in most cases. Difference of yield values of major radiolytic species from GEANT4-DNA results was within 10%. We computed DNA damages caused by monoenergetic 662 keV photons, approximately representing 137Cs decay. Single-strand break (SSB) and double-strand break (DSB) yields were 196 ± 8 SSB/Gy/Gbp and 7.3 ± 0.7 DSB/Gy/Gbp, respectively, which agreed with the result of 188 SSB/Gy/Gbp and 8.4 DSB/Gy/Gbp computed by Hsiao et al. Compared to computation using a single CPU, gMicroMC achieved a speedup factor of ~540x using an NVidia TITAN Xp GPU card. Conclusions: The achieved accuracy and efficiency demonstrated that gMicroMC can facilitate research on microscopic radiation transport simulation and DNA damage calculation. gMicroMC is an open-source package available to the research community. © 2020 American Association of Physicists in Medicine",Medical Physics,,,,,,17,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access

While the mathematics behind AI has existed for decades, its rapid adoption in virtually all sectors has been powered by open source, where a global community of academicians and data scientists are continuously developing and improving the mathematics behind the predictive and prescriptive solutions of the future. We posit that the existence of AI software development, which we describe as data driven analytical solutions providing predictive and prescriptive answers to questions, is solely due to the academia's focus on research and its pedagogical goals driving the dissemination of the research to the open source community to move the research to development. Indeed, all data science coursework is steeped in training on open source platforms and tools. When models do not depend on platforms, organizations can deploy flexible and agile software that has the ability to leverage better methods that come out in the future. Borrowing ideas from other industries we can see that just as Wordpress and its open source community of designers and developers revolutionized how websites are created, software that can quickly deploy the best available technology (and be mobile) while maintaining the security of the data is poised for user adoption and success where legacy systems and traditional dashboards fail. While the mathematics of physics does not change our confidence in its accuracy, in comparison, the mathematics of an AI algorithm is an approximation. This mathematics is being continuously improved though rarely achieving 100% accuracy. Algorithms are built upon open source AI libraries that are continuously improving. Similarly, the methods and techniques for developing the AI algorithms in oil and gas are continuously improving through two main sources, academia and adjacent industries reapplication of AI methods. We provide examples of open source technologies already part and parcel of all data scientists' repertoire of development, who are currently working in oil and gas.

Some previous research in the lean community has studied methods to improve end-user satisfaction and lean principles to incorporate operations knowledge into design. However, studies focusing on problems during operation and maintenance (O&M) due to design and construction errors and the learning loops into the design stage are still lacking. This is an ongoing research project which aims to develop an open-source tool that can be used by design teams to incorporate knowledge from previous projects. This paper reports on a taxonomy of lessons learned and a preliminary tool structure. To achieve this, post-occupancy evaluation data were collected from office buildings in Lima. Ten facility managers were interviewed to describe the main challenges during O&M. It was found that lessons learned can be categorized as wrong design assumptions, design flaws, poor specifications, constructions flaws, and maintainability issues. Moreover, facility managers face with high maintenance costs and substantive building rework. A preliminary database structure to capture and retrieve O&M lessons learned is presented. Further research includes the validation of the tool with clients, project managers, and design teams; and the development of an online tool for industry engagement. © 2020 IGLC 28 - 28th Annual Conference of the International Group for Lean Construction 2020.

With the growth of integration system, running all tests to verify the quality of submitted code, is clearly uneconomical. This paper aims at selecting a proper test subset for continuous integration so as to reduce test cost as much as possible without sacrificing quality. We first propose a static test case selection framework Sapient which aims at selecting a precise test subset towards fully covering all changed code and affected code. There are four major steps: locate changes, build dependency graphs, identify related tests by searching dependency graphs, and extend tests. Based on Sapient, we then develop a class-level test case selection approach FEST and a method-level approach MEST. FEST captures the class-level dependencies, especially the hidden references, which facilitates the modeling of full dependency relations at the class level. MEST combines two dynamic execution rules (i.e., dynamic invocation in reflection and dynamic binding in inheritance) with static dependencies to support building the precise method-level dependencies. Evaluation is conducted on 18 open source projects with 261 continuous integration versions from Eclipse and Apache communities. Results show that both FEST and MEST can detect almost all faults of two baselines (i.e., actual CI testing and ClassSRTS), and find new faults compared with actual CI testing (in 25% and 26% versions) and ClassSRTS (in 18% and 27% versions) respectively. Furthermore, MEST outperforms FEST in reduced test size, fault detection efficiency and test cost, indicating method-level test case selection can be more effective than class-level selection. This study can further speed up the feedback and improve the fault detection efficiency of CI testing, and has good application prospects for the CI testing in large-scale and complex systems. © 2020",Journal of Systems and Software,,,,,,1,Final,

Application of uncertainty quantification methods to the prediction of effusion cooled combustor liner temperature,,Gamannossi A.; Amerini A.; Poggiali M.; Elmi C.A.; Mazzei L.; Andreini A.,2020,,Conference paper,10.1115/GT2020-14793,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099778526&doi=10.1115%2fGT2020-14793&partnerID=40&md5=8894eee30581559d1fdcaf105820a659,Combustor; DAKOTA; Gas Turbine; Polynomial Chaos; Uncertainty Quantification,"As far as the preliminary thermal design of gas turbine components is concerned, 1-D codes are still widely used in standard industrial practice. Among the different components, the combustor is one of the most critical ones and its thermal design still greatly affects the reliability and life of the entire engine. During the initial phases of the design process, parameters are often roughly known. For this preliminary phase, a low-order approach is preferred instead of a high-fidelity simulation: the exploration of the whole space is extremely important to better understand the behavior of the system and to focus on the design objectives. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods, mainly developed in recent years and applied in many fields, are useful tools for the preliminary design phase and provide support during the whole design process. The objective of this work is to estimate the main sources of uncertainties in the design phase of an aeroengine effusion cooled combustor. The test case is based on a full annular lean-burn combustor, tested during the LEMCOTEC (Low EMissions COre-engine TEChnologies) European project. Among the test points investigated in the experimental campaign, the Approach condition is here analyzed. The inner liner is taken into consideration to investigate the metal temperature. Therm-1D, a 1-D in-house simulation code, is used to model the combustor and the open-source tool DAKOTA is adopted for the uncertainty quantification analysis. The baseline case of the combustor is studied and several uncertainty analyses are investigated. They are divided into 3 main groups: geometrical, tuning modelling parameters and thermal loads. For each group, the most relevant parameters are considered as a source of input uncertainty. In particular, a classical Monte Carlo approach is compared with four innovative polynomial-chaos approaches for each group: Gauss quadrature, total order with LHS sampling, stochastic collocation, and Smolyak. The analyses proved how the last two methods give the best results with a sensible lower amount of simulation (depending on the number of input variables). Lastly, results are compared with experimental data to achieve a better understanding of the most relevant input parameters and the propagation of their uncertainty on the results.

Meanwhile, mixture stratification and ϕ-sensitivity is frequently adopted in advanced compression ignition strategies to modulate heat release profile and control combustion phasing, such as homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) with partial fuel stratification (PFS), and premixed charge compression ignition (PCCI). Hence, ignition and combustion mode evolution in a stratified charge is of substantial significance in the understanding and prediction of combustion in advanced compression ignition engines. To probe complex combustion in a stratified charge, we have performed one-dimensional direct numerical simulations with detailed chemistry and transport, using a recently developed open source reacting flow CFD platform based on OpenFOAM 6.0. N-heptane is adopted in this work as a typical fuel exhibiting low temperature chemistry. Temperature and equivalence ratio gradient are varied among the simulations to observe ignition and the subsequent combustion development. Three stages of heat release are identified, including the low temperature chemistry chain branching, H2O2 chain branching and CO oxidation, consistent with the recent ignition experiment for lean n-heptane air mixture in a rapid compression machine (RCM).

Building a smart FNA cart: When Google meets cytology,,Haghighi M.; Nair V.; Mashiana S.S.; Oza T.; Zakowski M.F.,2020,13,Article,10.1002/cncy.22328,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090456223&doi=10.1002%2fcncy.22328&partnerID=40&md5=63cd0e12466f144cc2cc83b7f326bf76,5S; barcode; FNA; informatics; Kanban; Lean; quality; technology; VSM,"Background: The appropriate management of a fine needle aspiration (FNA) supply cart and equipment set up is essential to ensure the smooth and optimal operation of a busy FNA clinic. We applied Lean strategies such as value stream mapping (VSM), the 5S method (Sort, Set in order, Shine, Standardize, Sustain), and Kanban to remove waste and improve patient flow in an FNA clinic. Methods: The workflow analysis suggested that existent problems such as suboptimal inventory management and unavailability of standard operating procedures (SOPs) caused a 10% to 85% increase in total procedure time. To improve inventory management, we created a 2-bin Kanban system. We used the “Scan to Web” app and a Google Drive form to create a cost-effective electronic inventory management system. We distributed the essential SOPs in the format of video clips using our YouTube channel and leveraged barcode technology to access the links. Results: Upon completion of our process improvement project, we succeeded to eliminate the stock-out events and maintain a process cycle efficiency of 87%. The 5S audit checklist result increased from 6% to 100% implementation, which is consistent with focused improvement. The developed inventory system enabled us to track the supply usage, forecast demands, and improve the accuracy of orders. Conclusions: Lean methods such as VSM, 5S, and Kanban combined with open source technologies can be implemented to ensure material availability, track inventory, and provide immediate access to SOPs on demand. The developed system also led to increased efficiency and improved flow, as well as responsiveness to changes in demand. © 2020 American Cancer Society",Cancer Cytopathology,,,,,,0,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access
Component-based Development Using Moodle As Alternative for E-learning Software Development,,Jingga K.; Sunindyo W.D.,2020,5,Conference paper,10.1109/ICITEE49829.2020.9271670,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85098703158&doi=10.1109%2fICITEE49829.2020.9271670&partnerID=40&md5=ceca8270adddd3770f046960c4cecdb8,component-based development; e-learning; evaluation; integration model; Moodle,"This study used component-based development approach as alternative to develop software quickly and flexible. Moodle LMS as open source system was used as alternative to build e-learning software with traffic impact analysis (Andalalin) material as the case study. This study had done comparison design between system development from scratch and system development using existing component to prove that component-based development could be used as alternative for software development. The comparison started from development steps, strength and weakness of each methods, effort, and time. The effort and time estimation calculation were done by using adjusted story points (ASF) methods for Scrum methodology and COCOMO for CBSE methodology. To discover the flexibility of component-based development using Moodle, this study built additional component that related to the case study needs. After that, functional and nonfunctional testing was done towards the whole system which was developed using Moodle. This study also raised component addition model which could be used to integrate web-based additional component. The comparison result which was done in this study showed the development steps with component-based development were simpler than from scratch development. However, the effort estimation result for each methodology could not be compared, with the ASP value to calculate effort estimation was 1.1832 for Scrum methodology and 1.89 ManMonth for CBSE methodology from COCOMO calculation. Meanwhile, the time estimation result did not show the advantages of CBSE methodology because the calculation result was 12 weeks or 3 months for Scrum methodology and 3.18 months for CBSE methodology. The component additional model which was used to integrate web-based additional component into Moodle was successfully implemented. The evaluation result of Andalalin e-learning system showed the needs of Andalalin material learning could be fulfilled. Furthermore, the performance testing, which was done using Moodle Benchmark, found that the environment, where Moodle system was implemented, affected the system performance. From the usability testing and questionnaire result, the Moodle system was considered not difficult for respondents to use. Other than that, using the knowledge management system was considered helping respondent to understand the Andalalin material. © 2020 IEEE.",ICITEE 2020 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Information Technology and Electrical Engineering,"12th International Conference on Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, ICITEE 2020",6 October 2020 through 8 October 2020,"Virtual, Yogyakarta",165585,"IEEE Indonesia Section; IEEE Power and Energy Society (PES); IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society Chapter - Indonesia Section; Rolls Royce",0,Final,

flameFoam: An open source CFD solver for turbulent premixed combustion,,Povilaitis M.; Jaseliūnaitė J.,2021,,Article,10.1016/j.nucengdes.2021.111361,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85115986048&doi=10.1016%2fj.nucengdes.2021.111361&partnerID=40&md5=a29bf4f919978f424831ddce8d6891f4,Flame propagation; Hydrogen safety; OpenFOAM; Severe nuclear accidents; Turbulent premixed combustion,"Severe accidents in nuclear power plants may cause significant and long-lasting harm to the environment in the case of containment integrity loss. Numerical simulation of phenomena threatening containment integrity, e.g., hydrogen combustion and explosion, is essential for the effective severe accident management. International research projects and benchmarks are organized in order to promote improvement of simulation codes adequacy and accuracy in the severe accident relevant conditions. Results of the most recent benchmarks show that current state-of-the-art simulations were able to mostly reproduce the observable flame speed at the considered conditions, but there are still inadequacies in estimating velocity and its maximum value. Addressing a need for an accessible open source turbulent premixed combustion simulation tool, a new solver is being developed. An OpenFOAM version 7 based combustion solver called flameFoam has been built by implementing a progress variable approach and turbulent flame closure model for premixed combustion simulation. Turbulent flame speed is defined as a function of laminar flame speed and turbulence parameters, and is evaluated using one of three different correlations. Laminar flame speed can be set as a constant or calculated using a laminar flame speed correlation. The basis for the solver are standard compressible OpenFOAM solvers rhoPimpleFoam, buoyantPimpleFoam and chtMultiRegionFoam. The article presents initial public flameFoam version 0.8 and provides examples of its validation. Initial validation and verification of general solver features are represented by the simulations of shock tube and backward facing step cases. Solver capabilities in relation to the current turbulent premixed combustion modeling state-of-the-art are demonstrated with the simulations of ETSON-MITHYGENE benchmark experiments. It is shown that flameFoam version 0.8 is capable of adequate simulation of general flow features, turbulent compressible flow phenomena and turbulent premixed combustion of lean hydrogen-air mixtures at the considered conditions. Solver code is publicly hosted and being developed further. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Nuclear Engineering and Design,,,,,,2,Final,
Detailed Numerical Comparison of Laminar Burning Speed of Stratified Hydrogen-Air and Methane-Air Mixture with Corresponding Homogeneous Mixture Using Open-Source Code,,Rizvi M.S.,2021,,Article,10.1115/1.4049273,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100347933&doi=10.1115%2f1.4049273&partnerID=40&md5=cf1a9a574d186d9ca536a7b7160800cd,,"A detailed numerical study of laminar burning speed for fuel-Air mixture is conducted using laminarReactingLMFoam solver which is a modified version of reactingFoam solver based on openfoam code. It accounts for detailed mixture-Averaged transport property calculation for reacting flow using low-Mach number governing equations. The effect of various equivalence ratio gradients is studied on stratified hydrogen-Air and methane-Air mixture with mixture-Averaged transport model and unity Lewis number for all species, and corresponding laminar burning speed is compared with homogeneous mixture. For both the fuel-Air mixture, rich to lean stratified mixture resulted in a higher laminar burning speed and no significant difference was noticed for lean to rich stratified mixture when compared with homogeneous mixture at same local equivalence ratio. Increased burning speed is explained based on higher burnt gas temperature and molecular diffusion of lighter species from burnt gas referred to ""Chemical Effect"" in this study. The effect of thermal and molecular diffusion from the burnt gas on laminar burning speed is studied for stratified and homogeneous mixture using mixture-Averaged transport model and unity Lewis number for all species. It is shown that the molecular diffusion effect from burnt gas (""Chemical Effect"") is more prominent as compared with the thermal diffusion effect. Extension in lean flammability limit for stratified mixture of both the fuel is shown based on higher heat release rate as compared with homogeneous mixture and extension in flammability limit for stratified mixture is explained based on higher Chemical Effect from burnt gas. © 2021 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

In conjunction with the increment of these methodology, amount of scientific research on this topic has also increased. This research concentrates on one component from Agile software development which is User Stories (US). In a recent paper, quality framework for User Stories was proposed together with a tool implementing which is still minimal finding to achieve high quality of user story document. It is closely related to the data requirement as part of the success factor in development project. The main goal is to analyze US requirement written and identification of potential errors in datasets that bring the effectiveness in forecasting the quality of User Stories for monitoring purpose. One of the steps require to identify the quality User Stories is by the route passing through data cleaning process. The research analysis considers performing data cleaning and pre-processing towards existing dataset of user story requirement from open-source agile software projects. Results of analyzing the User Stories will reveal the possibility step of data cleaning as initial step to extend the AQUSA tools and forecast the quality of User Stories.

Toward a Reusable and Fail-safe Flight Software Architecture for Cost-Efficient Student Cubesat Missions,,Latachi I.; Karim M.; Rachidi T.,2021,,Conference paper,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127556984&partnerID=40&md5=17972e8675135015ddf8b5d37d935db7,Cubesat; fail-safe; flight software; reuse; satellite,"After decades of stagnation, the space sector is starting to draw considerable attention. Indeed, the advent of the cubesat concept started a new space era and ignited a considerable shift in satellite development paradigms since 1999. At the time of writing, over 1350 cubecats have been launched. Cubesats evolved from being an early curiosity with limited applications, to being an excellent tool for aerospace capacity-building, thus achieving national selfsustainability in this field. Subsequently, cubesats evolved into being a highly versatile test-bed platform achieving different mission objectives related to earth observation, telecommunication, deep-space exploration, etc. The key factors driving this revolution include standardization, advent of new technologies, agile development approaches, and entrepreneurship. Indeed, cubesats facilitated access to space by opening the possibility of using affordable offthe-shelf components and reusing open-source hardware and reference software architectures. Nevertheless, this flexibility multiplied the inherent risks commonly encountered in aerospace projects. These risks are further exacerbated by following ad-hoc development approaches, often due to the lack of simple guidelines in the literature. To mitigate these risks, it is crucial to devise reliable hardware and software architectures. Therefore, this work presents key processes to design a reusable and reliable software architecture for a student-built cubesat mission, and it will serve as an initial reference for flight software development in Morocco. Our development methodology is based on a system engineering approach applied throughout the mission life cycle within a custom-tailored ECSS framework. Moreover, our design approach relies on implementing a reliable hardware architecture using off-the-shelf modules with extensive flight-heritage, while focusing all efforts on developing a simple, yet reliable software solution that verifies key quality criteria, such as reliability, modularity, reusability and extensibility. To ensure over-all mission reliability, a feasible strategy was devised. It relies on using modular hardware and software architectures onboard, a hierarchical fault-tolerance architecture following the failsafe approach, defensive programming, and throughout software verification & validation testing. Finally, to ensure modularity, reusability and extensibility, the flight software follows a layered, service-oriented architecture with a finite state machine implemented in the application layer for deterministic execution of the mission functionalities. A client-server model, leveraging uniform APIs and CSP protocol network infrastructure, was also used to ensure resources access and enhance cross-platform data exchange. © 2021 International Astronautical Federation, IAF.

A new trend with the wide-spread of deep neural network applications is on-device AI. It is to process neural networks on mobile devices or edge/IoT devices instead of cloud servers. Emerging privacy issues, data transmission costs, and operational costs signify the need for on-device AI, especially if we deploy a massive number of devices. NNStreamer efficiently handles neural networks with complex data stream pipelines on devices, significantly improving the overall performance with minimal effort. Besides, NNStreamer simplifies implementations and allows reusing off-the-shelf media filters directly, which reduces developmental costs significantly. We are already deploying NNStreamer for a wide range of products and platforms, including the Galaxy series and various consumer electronic devices.

A 2D numerical wave flume, based on an open source computational fluid dynamics (CFD) package OpenFOAM, is applied for the numerical simulation. After numerical validations and convergent verifications, the characteristics of the fluid resonance in the gap between the twin rolling side-by-side barges are examined. The resonant frequency of the oscillating fluid in the gap between the twin rolling barges decreases compared with that between the twin fixed barges. Generally, the twin barges roll in the opposite directions, and their equilibrium positions lean oppositely with respect to the initial vertical direction. A physical model test is carried out for a further investigation, in which the twin barges are set oppositely leaning and fixed. From the present experimental results, a linear decrease of the resonant frequency with the increasing leaning angle is found. Combined with the numerical results, the deflection of the equilibrium positions of the twin barges is a relevant factor for the resonant frequency. Besides, the effects of the gap width and incident wave height on the fluid resonance coupled with roll motion are examined. © 2021, Chinese Ocean Engineering Society and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",China Ocean Engineering,,,,,,1,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access

Most existing methods rely on fixed-size counters, which may be wasteful in terms of space, as counters must be large enough to eliminate any risk of overflow. Instead, some solutions use small, fixed-size counters that may overflow into secondary structures.This paper takes a different approach. We propose a simple and general method called SALSA for dynamic re-sizing of counters, and show its effectiveness. SALSA starts with small counters, and overflowing counters simply merge with their neighbors. SALSA can thereby allow more counters for a given space, expanding them as necessary to represent large numbers. Our evaluation demonstrates that, at the cost of a small overhead for its merging logic, SALSA significantly improves the accuracy of popular schemes (such as Count-Min Sketch and Count Sketch) over a variety of tasks.

Thermoacoustic instability and flame transfer function in a lean direct injection model gas turbine combustor,,Joo S.; Kwak S.; Lee J.; Yoon Y.,2021,,Article,10.1016/j.ast.2021.106872,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107763670&doi=10.1016%2fj.ast.2021.106872&partnerID=40&md5=4da6497b6ad66e4eb816658d935baf65,Combustion instability; Flame transfer function; Lean direct injection combustor; Network modeling; OH-PLIF,"This paper discusses the combustion dynamic characteristics of hydrogen/methane flames and the flame response to fuel flow fluctuation in a model lean-direct injection gas turbine combustor. The results show that a higher frequency longitudinal thermoacoustic instability is triggered as hydrogen/methane ratios increase. The mode shift is accompanied by shortening flame length and hence decreasing convection time delay between fuel injection and flame location. The flame transfer function (FTF) subject to fuel flow rate modulation is determined over a range of frequencies for hydrogen/methane volume ratios of 25:75, 50:50, and 75:25 at a fixed equivalence ratio of 0.55. The input and output of the FTF are the velocity fluctuation of fuel-mixture at the inlet of the burner and the heat release fluctuation of flame in the combustion zone, respectively. Because of the difficulty of measuring fuel flow velocity at the inlet of the combustor while the flame exists, the fuel transfer function (FLTF) is measured and used along with the intermediate flame transfer function (ITF) to determine the FTF. The transfer functions are measured at frequencies up to 600 Hz and the FTF above 600 Hz is determined from the flame response at higher harmonic frequencies. Results of the FLTF measurement show that an acoustic resonance is formed within the fuel injector and the resonance frequency changes with the hydrogen/methane ratio as well as the length of the fuel feedline. The gain of FTF at a given frequency decreases as the hydrogen content increases and the absolute value of the slope of the phase plot, which is related to the convection time delay between fuel injector tip and flame location, decreases as the hydrogen enrichment ratio increases. Using the measured FTF as input to an open-source simulator, the occurrence of instability is predicted and compared with experimental results. The modeling results agree very well with the experimental data in predicting the occurrence of unstable combustion, the frequency at which unstable combustion occurs, and the acoustic mode inside the combustor. © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS",Aerospace Science and Technology,,,,,,18,Final,

However, despite the wide availability of tools and technology, developing intelligent applications in the industry framework remains a complex and expensive task. This paper proposes a lightweight, extensible and scalable framework called IoT Helper to facilitate the adoption of IoT and IIoT solutions both in industry and domotics. The framework is designed to be highly flexible and declarative in nature, thus allowing for a wide range of configurations with minimal user efforts. To emphasize the practical applicability or our proposal, we present two real-life use cases where the framework was successfully adopted. We also investigate a crucial aspect of these applications, i.e., what level of scalability can be achieved with a lean generic framework based on inexpensive components such as ours. Comprehensive experimental results show the excellent cost-to-performance ratio of our solution. We consider this to be an important contribution because it paves the way for a more widespread adoption of IIoT-enabling technologies in industry. © 2021 by the authors.

Recent work has demonstrated that the popular Planning Poker practice can produce reliable estimates when undertaken within a software team of knowledgeable domain experts. However, the process depends on the availability of experts and can be time-consuming to perform, making it impractical for large scale or open source projects that may curate many thousands of outstanding tasks. This paper reports on a full study to investigate the feasibility of using crowd workers supplied with limited information about a task to provide comparably accurate estimates using Planning Poker. We describe the design of a Crowd Planning Poker (CPP) process implemented on Amazon Mechanical Turk and the results of a substantial set of trials, involving more than 5000 crowd workers and 39 diverse software tasks.

This scenario is not foreign to companies dedicated to the development of open-source projects, whose products have experienced a boom over the last decade, leading more and more organizations to include them in their portfolios to improve their IT management, accelerate their digital transformation and boost their businesses. These changes are due to the unique qualities and characteristics of free software, which provide organizations with a wide range of helpful solutions for data analysis, distributed communication, or application deployment. It is essential for these types of companies, which are often supported by communities of developers, to have a culture and values aligned with agility, to prevent the numerous problems that may be caused by the lack of agility concerning the sustainability and transparency of their projects, thereby seriously damaging their competitiveness.

Story-point estimation enables software development teams to, among other things, better scope products, prioritize requirements, allocate resources and measure progress. Several machine learning techniques have been proposed for automated story-point estimation. However, most of these techniques use open-source projects for evaluation. There are important differences between open-source and commercial projects with respect to story authoring. The goal of this paper is to evaluate a state-of-the-art machine learning technique, known as Deep-SE [3], for estimating story points in a commercial project. Our dataset is comprised of 4,727 stories for a data anonymization product developed by a 27-member agile team at a healthcare data science company, IQVIA. Over this dataset, Deep-SE achieved a mean absolute error of 1.46, significantly better than three different baselines. Model performance nonetheless varied across stories, with the estimation error being larger for stories that had higher points. Our results further indicate that model performance is correlated with certain story characteristics such as the level of detail and the frequency of vague terms in the stories. An important take-away from our study is that, before organizations attempt to introduce machine learning-based estimation into agile development, they need to better embrace agile best practices, particularly in relation to story authoring and expert-based estimation.  © 2021 IEEE.",Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Requirements Engineering,"29th IEEE International Requirements Engineering Conference Workshops, REW 2021",20 September 2021 through 24 September 2021,"Virtual, Notre Dame",173221,,3,Final,

For software engineering instructors trying to teach such TPs to student teams, manually auditing teams if teams are following the TPs and improving over time is tedious, time-consuming and error-prone. It is even more difficult when those TPs involve two or more tools. For example, starting work on a feature in a project-management tool such as Pivotal Tracker should usually be followed relatively quickly by the creation of a feature branch on GitHub. Merging a feature branch on GitHub should usually be followed relatively quickly by deploying the new feature to a staging server for customer feedback. Few systems are designed specifically to audit such TPs, and existing ones, as far as we know, are limited to a single specific tool. We present Bluejay, an open-source extensible platform that uses the APIs of multiple tools to collect raw data, synthesize it into TP measurements, and present dashboards to audit the TPs. A key insight in Bluejay's design is that TPs can be expressed in terminology similar to that used for modeling and auditing Service Level Agreement (SLA) compliance. Bluejay therefore builds on mature tools used in that ecosystem and adapts them for describing, auditing, and reporting on TPs. Bluejay currently consumes data from five different widely-used development tools, and can be customized by connecting it to any service with a REST API.

To address these challenges, we introduce PowerWatch, an agile methodology to directly measure customer experience and aggregated grid performance without relying on the utility for deployment or management. PowerWatch employs a system of distributed sensors coupled with cloud-based analytics. We evaluate the PowerWatch methodology by deploying 462 sensors in homes and businesses in Accra, Ghana for over a year, yielding the largest open-source data set on electricity reliability at the customer-level in the region. We describe the architecture, design, and performance of PowerWatch, as well as the data that are collected, explaining how we determine the accuracy and coverage of our methodology without ground truth.

Despite the proven benefits and claimed potential of using a maptable in such processes, software applications specifically designed for this device are still scarce. Moreover, often-used applications do not fully exploit the touch functionality of a maptable, or have low usability. To address this gap, we developed and evaluated the Open Geospatial Interactive TOol (OGITO), an open-source software application designed to support collaborative spatial planning processes with a maptable. To develop such tool, we combined human-centred design and Agile software development principles in a co-design effort with intended users and stakeholders. Through iterative development cycles and feedback from users, OGITO was evolved until it satisfied user expectations. In a case study on community mapping in Sumatra, Indonesia, a sample of users evaluated OGITO's usability.

While hybrid OSS teams are becoming more prevalent, they also face unique challenges due to the involvement of different constituents. To address those challenges, this paper develops and validates a new organizing model. Specifically, the paper draws on media synchronicity theory (MST) to theorize that hybrid OSS teams would benefit from adopting an organizing model that involves practicing agile methods and using communication tools with multiple symbols sets and high transmission velocity. The paper also extends MST by conceptualizing the theory's key concept of communication convergence as consisting of two distinct dimensions: affective and cognitive convergence. Using primary survey data from hybrid OSS teams, the paper presents empirical evidence that such an organizing model can enhance those teams' affective convergence and cognitive convergence and, in turn, their development productivity and the quality of the software. In addition, the results show that affective convergence has a stronger impact on hybrid OSS teams' performance than cognitive convergence.  © 2021 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).",Data Base for Advances in Information Systems,,,,,,0,Final,

The information that the VIPER rover provides will help improve understanding of the composition, distribution, and accessibility of Lunar polar volatiles and will help determine how the Moon's resources can support future human space exploration. VIPER, however, represents a radical departure from the way that NASA has traditionally developed planetary robotic missions. A key consequence of these differences is that estimating the cost of VIPER's rover software is challenging and complex. For example, VIPER is being developed using management procedures typically applied to NASA research and technology projects, rather than space flight programs. In addition, key portions of the rover's software are being designed as ground software to run on mission control computers (rather than onboard the rover as flight software as with prior planetary missions) taking advantage of continuous, interactive data communications between the Moon and Earth and higher performance computing available on the ground. Moreover, the rover's software is being engineered using Agile software development practices and incorporates a significant amount of open-source code, rather than following traditional (spiral, waterfall, etc.) development methods and in-house code. In this paper, we present an innovative process to estimate the life cycle cost of VIPER's rover software. We first describe how we modeled the architecture and code counts for three software elements: Rover Flight Software (RFSW), Rover Ground Software (RGSW), and Rover Simulation Software (RSIM). We then discuss key challenges and unique aspects of our approach, such as the lack of Lunar rover analogies, the need to integrate and test large open source software, and the strategies developed to account for use of non-space flight management practices and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We conclude with a summary of our results, including cumulative distribution, nearest neighbors and cluster analysis, as well as heuristics used to confirm the reasonableness of the cost estimate. © 2021 IEEE.",IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings,"2021 IEEE Aerospace Conference, AERO 2021",6 March 2021 through 13 March 2021,Big Sky,170491,,2,Final,

Rapid technological advances open up opportunities to develop Geographical Information System (GIS) based mobile applications using embedded features inherent in mobile devices as well as application framework components and APIs. The evolution in Global Positioning System (GPS) technology has improved the accessibility and navigation accuracy in mobile applications. Islam has set some specific rukhsah (concession) concepts that can be applied by musafir (muslim travellers) including prayers of jama' and qasar (combine and shorten) if the journey exceeds two (2) marhalah which has been decided as 81km by Malaysian Islamic Authority. Currently there aren't any well-defined application available to assist them in fulfilling their obligation in Malaysia. myMarhalah is a mobile GIS application developed to facilitate musafir with their journey by displaying navigation routes, calculating travelled distances, identifying permissible leniency for prayers, locating nearby mosques, showing prayer times and listing the answers for frequently asked questions on related issues. The application uses open source native cross platform development that supports agile software development life cycle (SDLC) and allows DevOps to develop full native application for iOS and android simultaneously. This saves a lot of time in maintenance and upgrades. Equipped with artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies, myMarhalah provides multiple route options to users and dynamically changes active navigation based on user's decision. Integration with mosque location allows users to navigate to the mosque of their choice in the middle of the journey to perform prayer and navigate back to the final destination seamlessly. The application also adopted big data technology in its search and query functions for better user experience (UX). With the absence of distinct application for musafir in Malaysia, myMarhalah is the first one-stop mobile GIS application that provides convenient solution for them to implement the concession concept in their journey.

We designed the course by employing coding to associate DevOps concepts to Agile, Lean, and Open source practices and tools. We present the main aspects of this project-oriented DevOps course, with 240 students enrolled it since its first offering in 2016. We conducted an empirical study, with both a quantitative and qualitative analysis, to evaluate this project-oriented course setup. We collected the data from the projects repository and students' perceptions from a questionnaire. We mined 148 repositories (corresponding to 72 projects) and obtained 86 valid responses to the questionnaire.

They have been tasked with the development of a non trivial software product - a Twitter client capable of visual analytics - using some Agile practices, exploiting a Scrum-like process model, and using only open source tools. Due to circumstances that were either planned (in the selection of tools and requirements) or unintended (the pandemic forbade any physical meeting), the project had some interesting outcomes. The project was not easy to enact, neither for the students nor for the instructors. The main problems were two: the students were not ready to practice agile teamwork, and the open source tools they had to use were demanding and only partly suitable for the goal they were chosen for. We term this experience - where students applied an agile discipline and were required to use only open source tools - an “extreme” agile development project. This paper - written by two students together with their instructor, summarises some lessons learnt: characteristics and features of the tools and practices used, the evolution of product artifacts and some difficulties encountered, along with the solutions we adopted. An important lesson learnt is that an agile project developed by Computer Science students requires specific training in communicating correct information at the right moment, and avoiding telling “social lies” concerning the status of both the product and its development process. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Communications in Computer and Information Science,"1st International Conference on Frontiers in Software Engineering, ICFSE 2021",17 June 2021 through 18 June 2021,Innopolis,270689,,0,Final,

The teams used an integrated open-source development environment that we designed to be useful to support and measure Agile development efforts, storing all artifacts and logging productivity and interaction data. Moreover, teams were required to use the Essence visual language during the retrospectives in order to analyze and improve their Scrum-like process. The tools used by the teams were used to store and collect several process data, that post-mortem were also integrated by the answers given by the students to some questionnaires. This paper proposes an empirical evaluation of the process followed by the teams, using a teamwork quality model and an Agile maturity model.

This allows the agile management of complex IT portfolios or development programmes which require methodology which goes beyond the single-project-single-team scope of e.g. the basic Scrum approach. The SAFe methodology claims to be the right approach for lean enterprises. But this still assumes that it is implemented in a single organization with stable organizational setups and team structures and with professional staff. In contrast, we apply SAFe in a typical distributed and loose environment of an Open Source development project. Instead of a dedicated team, the involved staff is organized in an informal, open community of practice (OpenCoP) where participants join and leave and where staff contributes only certain amounts of time with a limited commitment. In addition, we deal with a university led IT programme which involves students as developers with limited experience and competence in professional project work. This paper presents the case study of the development of a Digital Education Ecosystem (DEE) for a Virtual Master School. The members of this Master School (including the students) are the co-developers and the users of the DEE. They form an OpenCoP which develops a customized IT system for their own needs. Applying SAFe in such an environment is new and challenging.

Additionally, the cloud is expanding towards the deep edge, forming a continuum in which the event-driven nature of the serverless paradigm seems to make a perfect match. The extreme heterogeneity introduced, in terms of diverse hardware resources and frameworks available, requires systematic approaches for evaluating serverless deployments. In this paper, we propose a methodology for evaluating serverless frameworks deployed on hybrid edge-cloud clusters. Our methodology focuses on key performance knobs of the serverless paradigm and applies a systematic way for evaluating these aspects in hybrid edge-cloud environments.

Several good techniques have been proposed for effective fault localization. These effective techniques justify the Lean methodology, where the waste process usually been avoided. However, most of the techniques are suffering with the problem of limited accuracy. To overcome the weakness of a technique there is a need of refinement and up-gradation of that technique. To achieve this, we can hybridize two different techniques to take advantages of both the techniques. In this paper, we propose to hybridize Mutation based testing with Spectrum based fault localization. This is a fact that both the techniques are rich in their domains. In our work, we are combining best of these techniques. We first create several mutants and drive along with the test cases to produce spectra for each mutant. This process is accountable under Agile Software Testing. These generated spectra for all mutants are supplied to fault localization techniques such as Tarantula, Barinel, Ochiai, and DStar to generate the statement ranking sequence for each mutant. Similarly, we compute the spectra for faulty program and also the statement ranking sequence. Based upon the similarity between the statement ranking sequence of faulty program and mutants, the bug is localized to most similar mutated line. We have experimented with nine open-source programs and achieved 36.48% improvement over existing FL techniques. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing,"5th International Conference on Lean and Agile Software Development, LASD 2021",23 January 2021 through 23 January 2021,"Virtual, Online",254659,,7,Final,

We aim to study the quality of User Stories and its evolution over time. Firstly, we develop a method to automatically monitor the quality of User Stories. Secondly, we investigate the relationship between User Story quality and project performance measures such as the number of reported bugs and the occurrence of rework and delays. We measure User Story quality with the help of a recently published quality framework and tool, Automatic Quality User Story Artisan (AQUSA). For our empirical work, we use six agile open source software projects. We apply time series analysis and use the Windowed Time Lagged Cross Correlation (WTLCC) method. Our results indicate that automatic User Story quality monitoring is feasible and may result in various distinct dynamic evolution patterns. In addition, we found the following relationship patterns between User Story quality and the software development aspects. A decrease/increase in User Story quality scores is associated with (i) a decrease/increase of the number of bugs after 1–13 weeks in short-medium projects, and 12 weeks in longer ones, (ii) an increase in rework frequency after 18–28, 8–15, and 1–3 weeks for long, medium, and short projects, respectively, and (iii) an increase in delayed issues after 7–20, 8–11, and 1–3 weeks for long, medium, and short duration projects. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing,"13th Software Quality Days Conference, SWQD 2021",19 January 2021 through 21 January 2021,Vienna,254649,,2,Final,

In the present work, chemical timescale and Borghi diagram analysis of hydrogen combustion have been presented. Based on these, a map of the flame propagation in the GraVent shock tube channel has been constructed; and it has been established that the propagation corresponds to the flamelet regime. Subsequently, CFD framework applicable to the flamelet regime such as the geometric approach with turbulent flame closure has been utilized to study deflagrations, FA and DDT. Such methods allow for the computation of pressure transients and flame propagation characteristics with a relatively coarse grid, thereby enabling a balance between computational time and accuracy. Moreover, specific sub-models based on Lewis number and tuned to lean combustion at high pressures have been implemented to further improve the accuracy of the numerical results. All numerical work has been carried out using the open-source numerical platform OpenFOAM. Several numerical simulations with uniform and transversely stratified initial distribution have been carried out and validated with experimental data. In the stratified case, an asymmetric flame front has been observed and is identified to be a key parameter leading to strong FA. Detailed analysis shows that several pressure pulses and shock complexes are formed upstream of the flame. The ensuing shock–flame interaction augments the flame speed ultimately resulting in DDT. Comparative simulations with uniform distribution also show strong FA but DDT does not take place. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Combustion Science and Technology,,,,,,8,Final,

Mixed reality can provide a new way of combining remote collaboration with innovative 3D visualizations to analyze the project status. In this paper, we present a visual immersive analytics framework for project management (VIAProMa). It imports data from project management tools like the GitHub issue tracker for open-source projects. With these task data as the basis, it can generate three-dimensional visualizations, e.g. about the overall progress or the competences of individual developers. Developers, stakeholders and end users can meet in the collaborative virtual environment as avatars and establish a spatial structure with the task cards and visualizations. Therefore, VIAProMa with its adapted and customized mixed reality project management features supports both the shared meetings and the information flow in the project. The shared environment makes it a suitable tool for DevOpsUseXR, an extension to the DevOps workflow, where end users are able to participate in the development process in mixed reality. The resulting implementation is available as an open-source project with cross-platform capabilities targeting the Microsoft HoloLens, HTC VIVE and Android smartphones, as well as tablets. The framework is applied in university teaching classes to convey agile methodology in mixed reality programming practices. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),"8th International Conference on Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality and Computer Graphics, AVR 2021",7 September 2021 through 10 September 2021,"Virtual, Online",265419,,3,Final,

However, software industries usually apply a lot of convincing strategies to ensure the delivery of bug-free software products. Due to the iterative and incremental nature of Agile projects, testing activities are simultaneously organized by the Scrum Masters along with the routine development exercises. Regression testing is such type of testing technique that is performed to corroborate and ensure the impact of any new code in the existing modules of the software product. Proper optimization practices can reduce the efforts and time required to conduct Regression Testing. Although, it is quite challenging to optimize regression testing activities. So there is a need to implement an automotive regression testing mechanism that is based on associated risks and test prioritization to reduce the testing time and effort of testing engineers. In this research paper, we discussed the challenges and strategies to develop optimized regression testing in Agile methodologies. By adopting this mechanism, professionals can reduce their testing effort and time while developing Agile software products to a great extent.  © 2021 IEEE.","2021 5th International Conference on Information Systems and Computer Networks, ISCON 2021","5th International Conference on Information Systems and Computer Networks, ISCON 2021",22 October 2021 through 23 October 2021,Mathura,177293,,0,Final,

As it is generally more noticeable at school age, it has become one of the causes of school dropouts or poor performance, especially in reading and writing, activities that are essential for academic development. This research developed a serious video game that he called Dyslexia kids (DK); based on gamification techniques and some evaluation criteria by inspection to ensure quality, in order to reduce the impact of dyslexia in children 6 to 9 years of age. Technically, patterns were used for video game development and open source tools. Dyslexia kids (DK) was developed in the Spanish language from the perspective of neurolinguistic programming incorporating visual, auditory and kinesic teaching techniques. Psychology experts in learning disorders evaluated DK; likewise, experts in serious video game development, reaching 80% acceptability. It was tested with four (5) boys and girls aged between 6 and 9 years; DK showed that it reduced the impact of dyslexia on learning activities by 68%. It is suggested, to improve the results, apply the tool to a greater number of boys and girls.

Minimum ignition energy and propagation dynamics of laminar premixed cool flames,,Yang Q.; Zhao P.,2021,7,Article,10.1016/j.proci.2020.06.351,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85091024084&doi=10.1016%2fj.proci.2020.06.351&partnerID=40&md5=1688815a49b5ce433a7e97d897cd314e,Cool flame; Flame regimes; Flammability limit; Minimum ignition energy; Stretched premixed cool flames,"Laminar premixed cool flames, induced by the coupling of low-temperature chemistry and convective-diffusive transport process, have recently attracted extensive interest in combustion and engine research. In this work, numerical simulations have been conducted using a recently developed open-source reacting flow platform reactingFOAM-SCT, to investigate the minimum ignition energy (MIE) and propagation dynamics of premixed cool flames in a 1D spherical coordinate. Results have shown that when ignition energy is below the MIE of regular hot flames, a class of cool flames could be initiated, which allow much wider flammability limits, both lean and rich, compared to hot flames. Furthermore, the overall cool flame propagation dynamics exhibit intrinsic similarity to those of hot flames, in that, they begin with an ignition kernel propagation regime, followed by two transition regimes, and eventually reach a normal flame propagation regime. However, a spherical expanding cool flame responds completely differently to stretch. Specifically, a regular outwardly propagating hot spherical flame accelerates with increasing stretch rate when the mixture Le < 1 and decelerates when Le > 1. However, it is found that a cool flame always tends to decelerate with increasing stretch rate regardless of mixture composition, exhibiting unique flame aerodynamic characteristic. This research discovers novel features of premixed cool flame initiation and propagation dynamics and sheds light on flame transition, spark-ignition system design, and advanced engine combustion control. © 2020",Proceedings of the Combustion Institute,,,,,,7,Final,
Assessing the risk of software development in agile methodologies using simulation,,Lunesu M.I.; Tonelli R.; Marchesi L.; Marchesi M.,2021,18,Article,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3115941,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85117029269&doi=10.1109%2fACCESS.2021.3115941&partnerID=40&md5=7e7b08c2a940ad36a022438cd0900a32,Agile; Effort estimation error; Monte Carlo methods; Random issue allocation; Risk analysis; Simulation; Software development management; Software process simulation,"Agile methodologies aim to reduce software development risk using short iterations, feature-driven development, continuous integration, testing automation, and other practices. However, the risk of project failure or time and budget overruns is still a relevant problem. This paper aims to present and discuss a new approach to model some key risk factors in agile development, using software process simulation modeling (SPSM), which can complement other approaches, and whose usage is particularly suited for agile development. We introduce a new approach to modeling some key risk factors - namely project duration, number of implemented issues, and key statistics of issue completion time - using a simulator of agile development, which we developed for this purpose. The approach includes modeling the agile process, gathering data from the tool used for project management, and performing Monte Carlo simulations of the process, to get insights about the expected time and effort to complete the project, and about their distributions. The model's parameters that can cause risk are errors in effort estimation of the features to develop, variations in developers' assignment to these features, impediments related to developers' availability and work completion. To validate the simulator, and to demonstrate how the method can be used, we analyzed three open-source projects, gathering their data from JIRA repositories. We ran Monte Carlo simulations of these projects, showing that the simulator can well approximate the progress of the real project, then varying the identified risk factors and statistically evaluating their effects on the risk parameters. The proposed approach is relevant for project managers, being able to quantitatively evaluate the risks, provided that the process and the project's data are properly modeled and gathered. As for the future, we are working to improve our risk assessment method, evaluating it on more case studies, scaling the model from a single team to multiple teams involved in one or more projects.  © 2013 IEEE.",IEEE Access,,,,,,3,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access

In tourism destination development globally, the aim for sustainable digital transformation in low-productivity business sectors is one of the key drivers for smart tourism and smart destination development. More recently, the global Covid-19 pandemic has given a boost to touchless, digital and green tourism development initiatives in the EU and worldwide. To advance sustainable digital transformation with agile methods in STD development, a systemic service platform approach and agile prototyping with smart emerging technologies, (eg. with AI, IoT, Augmented Virtual Reality, 5G and Robotics), and multi-stakeholder co-creation is needed to engage key tourism industry ecosystem representatives.

This situation is especially critical with the increase of the number of patients because of the pandemic of COVID-19. In the present work, a web-based medical records management system was developed with an easy-to-use interface for digital immigrant users. For the management and development of the project, the XP (eXtreme Programming) methodology of the software life cycle was successfully applied. The system was developed using open source technologies: PHP as programming language and the Bootstrap framework for the design of user interfaces. The result was an elegant and modern user interface that provides ease of use to digital immigrant users. The system was validated through an experimental evaluation carried out at the medical center of “La Concordia”, in Ecuador. This evaluation was based on Jakob Nielsen usability principles and the software product quality norms of the ISO/IEC 25010 standard. The heuristic validation of the proposal resulted in a 93% of acceptance whilst function tests where successful in 96% of times. Besides, the result of a SUS test with the participation of five digital immigrants turn out in a 91.5% of system usability. Finally, it is worth mentioning that this software is now in exploitation in a local medical center with successful results. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Communications in Computer and Information Science,"2nd International Conference on Applied Technologies, ICAT 2020",2 December 2020 through 4 December 2020,"Virtual, Online",257279,,0,Final,
Agile Development of Machine Learning (ML) for Conventional Artificial Lift Systems in the Middle-East,,Andrade A.; Vargas L.; Mackay A.; Ajmi A.,2022,,Conference paper,10.2118/211112-MS,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85143088106&doi=10.2118%2f211112-MS&partnerID=40&md5=a8e7fe55f419eca92cebefefd67d015c,,"Most of Oman's southern fields are produced by beam-pumps which are installed in approximately 2,000 wells. Globally beam pumps remain an extremely popular choice for secondary lift. Identification and diagnosis of beam pumps performance using dynamometer cards (dynocards) is an expensive human visual interpretation process that requires both significant labor time and deep expertise in the production technology domain. The team tasked with developing an improved diagnostic method had three goals: 1) use open-source analytics, 2) develop a machine learning application (ML) to solve business challenges and finally 3) foster solutions with significant value investment ratio (VIR). In this case, a proof-of-concept application was developed to automatically screen beam pump dynocards and identify abnormalities undetected by conventional monitoring systems such as electrical related failures causing improper operation of the well, leading to deferment, undetected by conventional monitoring systems, and/or mechanical damage. An analytics minimum viable product (MVP) was developed for pattern recognition that significantly assisted in automating (analysis of a 100 hundred wells with real-time data in less than 1 second) the visual interpretation process, increasing efficiency, and reducing maintenance activities due to missed early diagnosis. With the system, an analysis of 100 wells with real-time data was performed in less than a minute. The system detects current and future abnormal conditions that cause improper operation of the artificial system to deferment and potentially to mechanical damage. This new system identifies and highlights these wells so that operations and maintenance staff can focus their attention where it is really needed, improving their workflows and decision making. This paper outlines how applying ML along with the scaled agility methodology enabled the operator to develop an MVP and diagnose abnormalities on daily basis not raised by any other system. Of the 100 wells in the selected field approximately 10% were identified with clear failures. This translated to an approximate ~5 % improvement in lead indicator (prior to issues) detection projecting ~2.5 million USD in efficiencies and deferment reduction. There was no CAPEX cost as the team developed this entirely on open-source platforms that were license free and independent without needing third-party application or resources.

The framework was designed to enable new scientific frontiers in seismology by providing a means to more effectively utilize massively parallel computers to handle the increasingly large data volume available today. MsPASS leverages several existing technologies: (1) scalable parallel processing frameworks, (2) NoSQL database management system, and (3) containers. The system leans heavily on the widely used ObsPy toolkit. It automates many database operations and provides a mechanism to automatically save the processing history for reproducibility. The synthesis of these components can provide flexibility to adapt to a wide range of data processing workflows. We demonstrate the system with a basic data processing workflow applied to USArray data.

The software is by essence complex, since it should capture all the particularities of a domain. The development is also complex because many people with different skills and concerns participate to build a unique product that must satisfy the attribute of conceptual integrity. Agile methods like Scrum, help to mitigate these problems using incremental and iterative development. Although new developments can be successful, it could be challenging to be agile after several months. Analysts have to deal with a lot of requirements scattered and tangled across several User Stories written in different Sprints. And the developers need to find the module where a certain requirement is implemented. When teams are very volatile and members move around different projects it is even more complex. In this paper, we propose an approach to provide traceability among requirement specifications and the source code. Additionally, the approach is supported by a tool that analyses the requirements and the source code to derive the Language Extended Lexicon, a glossary that describes the language of the domain and integrates requirements and source code to provide traceability among them. We have assessed the applicability of our approach by processing an open-source project.

Challenges in this area are compounded when the system is developed under some offspring of Agile methodologies, which favor iterative development and rapid feedback from extensive testing. The authors of this paper build upon previous work investigating the common challenges and solutions cited in recent peer-reviewed research on this topic to design and build a tool consolidating many of the concepts found in this investigation. The tool is known as LuluPerfTest (LPT) and is an NFR testing framework meant to plug into continuous integration (CI) systems to run NFR tests configured with a JSON script. This allows developers and testers to build maintainable and minimally complex automated NFR test scripts. This study explains the challenges inherent in NFR testing in Agile software development and presents how LPT confronts those challenges.

Currently, the collection and storing of microbial culture data is performed manually via various data transfers into record books, logbooks, or spreadsheets. However, the manual process seems to be impractical as it is highly prone to human error and time-consuming, aside from the struggle of managing and retrieving the data. Therefore, to address this issue, we have successfully designed and developed a customized database for microbial data collection that allows users to store, access, visualize and retrieve information in a single platform. The agile development approach has been implemented during the software development process allowing more flexibility during the development phase yet managing to fulfill the functional requirements of the end-users. The front end is created using the Bootstrap framework, an open-source and powerful platform for developing user-friendly web pages and web applications. It is connected to the back-end MySQL database as a relational database management system to organize structured data. As a result, the developed microbial culture collection has eliminated manual data entry and accelerated the data retrieval process.

Observing multiple physiological reactions to the same stimuli will help researchers gain a better understanding of how the human body responds. However, there is limited availability of multimodal physiological sensor setups. This article presents an approach utilizing the open-source distribution Lab Streaming Layer (LSL) which records, synchronizes, and exports high-quality data from multiple sensory measures. The challenge is to adapt proprietary hardware to utilize LSL, as most sensors are pre-programmed to interact with their own software. The aim is to reduce the cost associated with subscriptions to proprietary software, by switching to the open-source alternative which promotes higher quality, greater reliability, greater flexibility, and lower cost. The article presents a case where the proprietary sensors, electrocardiogram (ECG) and galvanic skin response (GSR) provided by Shimmer, adapt to the LSL network. Given the multidisciplinary aspect of the case both Wayfaring, Extreme Programming (XP), and Scrum were used as development methodologies. A description is provided of the software architecture for collecting data from the two Shimmer sensors and how the signals are transmitted to the LSL network. In addition, the article encourages the use of open-source resources and discusses the benefits that open research brings. Open research offers similar potential as open-source development in terms of rapidity and innovation. The advantage of allowing researchers to benefit from other researchers’ findings and results leads to advances that would not have been possible in a closed, or proprietary, environment. In light of the insights acquired in the development process, questions regarding companies’ attitudes toward open research are addressed. Moreover, the article adds to the field of open research by broadening the possibilities for experimental setups facilitating the acquisition of new knowledge. © Proceedings of NordDesign 2022: How Product and Manufacturing Design Enable Sustainable Companies and Societies.",Proceedings of NordDesign 2022: How Product and Manufacturing Design Enable Sustainable Companies and Societies,NordDesign 2022: How Product and Manufacturing Design Enable Sustainable Companies and Societies,16 August 2022 through 18 August 2022,Copenhagen,184292,,0,Final,

Agile software development is exceedingly difficult and has contentious issues in literature and business. Since most Agile techniques place more emphasis on development than software testing activities, different people have varying opinions about how software testing fits into these methodologies. Agile places a high emphasis on frequent deliveries and tight client connections. However, software testing is complex because agile does not incorporate many destructive testing techniques typically required for a product of higher-quality. The study reveals industry-wide Agile testing procedures and the main problems that arise when Agile development is used. Additionally covered are the differences between manual and automated testing, best automation practices, and ways to lead different testing teams in an agile testing environment. This study covers every facet of the Agile software testing process. Agile development has shown that testing is not a distinct stage but rather a crucial component of software development along with the coding. The agile team employs an overall strategy to produce software products of the highest quality. As part of an agile team, testers collect customer samples of the desired behaviour and collaborate with the developer's team to help the coders translate these examples into executable specifications. Coding and testing are done iteratively and incrementally, developing every item until it is valuable enough to release in production. It addresses several testing modalities. The classification provided by its quadrants aids teams in determining and organizing the necessary tests. To increase quality assurance, this article will examine various and improved Agile Testing Processes and methodologies. Additionally, the topic of Agile development's software testing method is covered.

This paper introduces the PipeGraph software library, an open-source python toolbox for easing the creation of machine learning models by using Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-like implementations that can be used for CPS. scikit-learn’s Pipeline is a very useful tool to bind a sequence of transformers and a final estimator in a single unit capable of working itself as an estimator. It sequentially assembles several steps that can be cross-validated together while setting different parameters. Steps encapsulation secures the experiment from data leakage during the training phase. The scientific goal of PipeGraph is to extend the concept of Pipeline by using a graph structure that can handle scikit-learn’s objects in DAG layouts. It allows performing diverse operations, instead of only transformations, following the topological ordering of the steps in the graph; it provides access to all the data generated along the intermediate steps; and it is compatible with GridSearchCV function to tune the hyperparameters of the steps. It is also not limited to (X, y) entries. Moreover, it has been proposed as part of the scikit-learn-contrib supported project, and is fully compatible with scikit-learn. Documentation and unitary tests are publicly available together with the source code. Two case studies are analyzed in which PipeGraph proves to be essential in improving CPS modeling and optimization: the first is about the optimization of a heat exchange management system, and the second deals with the detection of anomalies in manufacturing processes. © 2022 by the authors.

However, these tools do not always communicate well together, compromising the efficiency of the whole process. Highly inspired by the markdown/pandoc system, we developed Peccary, an R package and its dedicated Shiny Application with the objective to accelerate the use of previously released R packages through various translation and metaprogramming processes.  Methods: Peccary was developed with an agile method, progressively aggregating snippets of R code produced during real-life pharmacometrics works.  Its first subpackage, PeccAnalysis, can be used to produce and evaluate various R code for population description (using table1 package), plot exploration (ggplot) and non-compartment analysis (pknca). The second subpackage, PeccaReverse, allows writing a structural model using a minimalist (simplified deSolve) syntax, before metaprogramming model simulations (using either deSolve or RxODE) and design evaluation (through PopED), along with performing various model syntax translations (e.g., into NONMEM, Monolix or nlmixr files). Finally, the third subpackage, PeccaResult, standardizes run outputs of several PMx software (NONMEM, Monolix, Adapt, nlmixr) to perform various diagnostic evaluation tasks.  Results: The metaprogramming system used in PeccAnalysis and PeccaReverse has many advantages. First, it simplifies the use of previously mentioned packages (by reducing the required knowledge and the time needed to program the output creation). Second, it creates links between independent tools (for instance using the same inputs for several tasks). Third, the produced R code can be reviewed for eventual manual modification, verification (quality control) or traceable report integration.  Conclusion: Overall, Peccary was successful in improving PMx efficiency by providing a Shiny R platform that can produce various outputs during live meetings while keeping the possibility to extract Peccary-independent R source code for further in-depth control.

Large-eddy simulations of self-excited thermoacoustic instability in a premixed swirling combustor with an outlet nozzle,,Sun Y.; Zhao D.; Ji C.; Zhu T.; Rao Z.; Wang B.,2022,,Article,10.1063/5.0087055,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129116977&doi=10.1063%2f5.0087055&partnerID=40&md5=2eec49a5470861d8953f03e955e69881,,"Reducing the footprint of greenhouse gases and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions from combustion systems means that they have been operating under lean or ultra-lean fuel-air premixed conditions. Under such conditions, self-excited large-amplitude pulsating thermoacoustic instabilities may occur, characterized by deafening combustion noises and even ""violent""structural vibrations, which is, therefore, highly undesirable in practice. By conducting chemical reaction-thermodynamics-acoustics-swirling flow coupling investigations, we have numerically explored the generation and mitigation mechanisms of self-excited pulsating oscillations in a methane-fueled swirling combustor in the presence and absence of an outlet nozzle. Hence, a large-eddy simulation was performed on a fully three-dimensional compressible flow via an open-source platform, OpenFOAM. Furthermore, a thorough assessment was made to understand the fundamental physics of the interaction of the swirling flame, either constructively or destructively, to the acoustic pressure perturbations by examining the local Rayleigh criterion/index. A further explanation was made on implementing the outlet nozzle that can mitigate such periodic pulsating combustion via attenuating the fuel fraction fluctuations, vortices processing, and changing temperature field. It was also found that the dominant pulsating mode is switched from the 1/4 standing-wave wavelength mode to the 3/4 wavelength mode. Finally, more physical insights were obtained by conducting a proper orthogonal decomposition analysis on the energy distribution between the thermoacoustic modes.  © 2022 Author(s).",Physics of Fluids,,,,,,25,Final,
An impact-driven approach to predict user stories instability,,Levy Y.; Stern R.; Sturm A.; Mordoch A.; Bitan Y.,2022,17,Article,10.1007/s00766-022-00372-w,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126520918&doi=10.1007%2fs00766-022-00372-w&partnerID=40&md5=88ecb6005c8f095287ac5364d7f55b17,Agile software development; Machine learning; Requirements; User story,"A common way to describe requirements in Agile software development is through user stories, which are short descriptions of desired functionality. Nevertheless, there are no widely accepted quantitative metrics to evaluate user stories. We propose a novel metric to evaluate user stories called instability, which measures the number of changes made to a user story after it was assigned to a developer to be implemented in the near future. A user story with a high instability score suggests that it was not detailed and coherent enough to be implemented. The instability of a user story can be automatically extracted from industry-standard issue tracking systems such as Jira by performing retrospective analysis over user stories that were fully implemented. We propose a method for creating prediction models that can identify user stories that will have high instability even before they have been assigned to a developer. Our method works by applying a machine learning algorithm on implemented user stories, considering only features that are available before a user story is assigned to a developer. We evaluate our prediction models on several open-source projects and one commercial project and show that they outperform baseline prediction models. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",Requirements Engineering,,,,,,1,Final,
Transient process of methane-oxygen diffusion flame-street establishment in a microchannel,,Kang X.; Wang Y.,2022,11,Article,10.1007/s11708-021-0755-y,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85109026992&doi=10.1007%2fs11708-021-0755-y&partnerID=40&md5=e6043ac0ffcae71c645b8de77d7a5fa4,diffusion flame; flame propagation speed; flame-street; micro-combustion; mixing layer,"“Flame-street” is an interesting diffusion flame behavior in which a series of flame-segments is separately distributed along the mixing layer in a narrow channel. This experimental phenomenon was experimentally and numerically investigated with the focus on the steady-state, thermo-chemical flame structures in previous literature. In the present paper, the dynamic formation process of a methane-oxygen diffusion flame-street structure was simulated with a reacting flow solver developed based on the open-source framework OpenFOAM. By imposing a certain amount of ignition-energy near the channel outlet, a reaction-kernel was formed and bifurcated. Subsequently, three separate flames were consecutively generated from this kernel and propagated within the channel. The whole process was completed within 15 ms and all the discrete flames were eventually in a steady-state. Interestingly, different propagation features were observed for the three flame segments: The leading flame experienced a flame shape/type change from a tribrachial structure in its fast-propagating phase to a long, trailing diffusion tail after being anchored to the inlet. The successive flame had a much lower propagation speed, keeping its two wing-like (fuel-lean premixed and fuel-rich premixed) structure while moving toward its stabilization location, which was approximately in the middle of the channel. The last flame, after the ignition source was turned-off, was immediately convected a bit downstream, and eventually featured a similar two-branch-like structure as the second one. Moreover, chemical insights for the premixed and diffusion branches of the leading flame were also provided with the change of significance of some key elementary reactions focused on, in order to attain a detailed profiling of the flame-type transition. This paper is a first-ever one discussing the transient formation of flame-streets in literature and is believed to be useful for obtaining a comprehensive understanding of this unique flame characteristics from a dynamic point of view. © 2021, Higher Education Press.",Frontiers in Energy,,,,,,0,Final,

In this context, a central challenge is to reduce as much as possible the duration of the feedback loop, allowing stakeholders to reduce their time-to-market and release process duration. This paper describes how to model a product backlog (usually expressed as informal user stories in plain text in an agile context) as a queryable graph-based model. This graph is automatically extracted from existing artifacts thanks to natural language processing techniques. Then, developers and product owners can support their iteration planning process by leveraging the model, enacting a short-range impact analysis feedback loop of their planning decisions. The approach considers the iterative and incremental nature of agile methods through the definition of composition operators to incrementally build the models. We have validated this approach on five industrial scenarios, on top of a reference open-source dataset of 22 product backlogs, representing 1, 671 user stories © 2022.

For the implementation of optimized, effective DTs of gearboxes, engineers often lean on the ISO Standards and Codes. However, the use of Standards could be not trivial to setup, slow and with license problems for its portability. Neural Networks (NNs), also implemented on open-source software, has been proved to be able to create links between input and output quantities without the need of knowing the underlying laws if trained properly. Here we trained a NN with a huge dataset created by using Standards for a simple gearbox. By comparing with Standards, we found that the accuracy of a NN depends on the safety factor, the physical characteristics of the gearbox and correct setup of the NN. This result is of paramount interest since it reveals that NNs can be used for the implementation of accurate digital twins when a proper training on a wide dataset is carried out. © 2022 18th International Conference on Condition Monitoring and Asset Management, CM 2022.

One of the key indicators of that inefficient software design is a high degree of code coupling, which leads to unwanted side-effects during refactoring and acts as a burden during future development. To alleviate these problems, we developed a visualization tool, ADA, that statically analyzes an open-source repository and seeks to address the issue of code coupling by providing developers with a powerful graphic representation. ADA showcases the relationships and the degree of inter-connectivity between the classes. ADA will ultimately guide developers to instantly locate the coupled area and assist them in decoupling it.  © 2022 ACM.","SOAP 2022 - Proceedings of the 11th ACM SIGPLAN International Workshop on the State Of the Art in Program Analysis, co-located with PLDI 2022","11th ACM SIGPLAN International Workshop on the State Of the Art in Program Analysis, SOAP 2022, co-located with the 43rd ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation, PLDI 2022",14 June 2022,San Diego,185484,ACM; ACM SIGPLAN,0,Final,

This design method is suitable for algorithm engineers to implement calculation prototypes and is not suitable for hardware engineers to design circuits from the register transfer level. In addition, from the perspective of agile development and code reuse, C, C++, and System C are far from another hardware description language, Chisel. However, there are relatively few electronic design automation tools for Chisel, so we propose a circuit design flow based on CGRA hardware, in which Chisel designs the PE unit of CGRA. However, Chisel has few electronic design automation tools, so a circuit design flow based on CGRA is proposed. Dedicated data flow graph generation tools and typical coarse-grained reconfigurable arrays are implemented for this design flow. This article describes a design process based on CGRA and compares the design process with HLS through the DCT circuit design process. Through the experimental comparison of the two circuit implementation processes, it is found that, first of all, the correctness of the CGRA-based design process and the availability of data flow diagram generation tools. Secondly, from a design point of view, the use of Chisel will increase the overall development speed and increase the reusability of design files. Finally, from the perspective of toolchains, part of the tools in the new design process uses open-source toolchains, which reduces the cost of using toolchains and promotes the development of toolchains to a certain extent.  © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

Such test cases have been successfully and extensively adopted to test different software levels, from unit tests (e.g., JUnit) to end-to-end Web Graphical User Interface (GUI) tests (e.g., Selenium Webdriver). While test execution is mostly automated by existing tools, test design remains a manual task. In the pursuit of a more automated test case generation approach, the use of models has been advocated by the model-based testing (MBT) technique. Current MBT approaches assume a top-down workflow in which testers design models, test cases are generated from models, and then scripts are written to automate test execution. Nevertheless, writing automated tests is nowadays a developer’s responsibility and testers face a scenario in which automated tests might be reused to produce new model-based tests. This paper aimed to improve the synergy between existing automated tests and MBT. To do so, we present an approach that infers a model from existing tests, a tester leverages this model to include new tests, and then test code is generated. We analyzed the proposed approach in the context of Web applications with system-level GUI tests that employ the Page Object pattern. For MBT, we adopted event-driven models augmented with parameters and test input data. We evaluated the approach’s applicability with a prototype tool called MoLeWe and an experimental study with nine open-source Web applications. The results provide some evidence that using MoLeWe may help to include new tests faster than manually coding them, while increasing the overall code coverage of the test suite. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Software Quality Journal,,,,,,0,Final,

One of the main problem with agile methodologies is the quality and the quantity of testing tasks to be performed, which in many cases are focused on unitary testing. This causes different issues for agile projects at the integration of sub-systems or the acceptance of the products developed. Continuous integration (CI) technique is commonly used to avoid some integration problems because it improves the validation of the software products by means of the automatic execution of different test cases at the moment of updating a software product located in a version control platform. Nevertheless, these test cases are manly focused on unitary testing and they are created for specific platforms. This paper presents an open source framework to improve continuous integration in order to execute acceptance test cases automatically. In particular, we use Behavioral Driven Development (BDD) to create the test cases that can be used with web and mobile drivers for different platforms.

Compared with previous computer instruction architectures, RISC-V has outstanding features such as simple instructions, modular instruction set and supporting agile development. Due to these advantages, a large number of chips have been designed based on RISC-V ISA. However, compared with other ISAs, the efficiency or performance of RISC-V architecture is still not clear. In this paper, we investigate the performance difference of three mainstream RISC processor systems (i.e., ARM, MIPS and RISC-V). We use two open source benchmark tools-UnixBench and LMbench, to widely evaluate the processor performance, such as computing efficiency, read and write file delay, local communication bandwidth, etc. A total of 19 detailed performance tests on these three ISA systems are carried out. The testing results show: i) MIPS achieves the highest scores and shortest context switching delay whether it has a large number of file copying or pipeline communication; ii) RISC-V has high local communication bandwidth and strong scientific computing capabilities, but has highest communication and file access delays; iii) ARM’s local communication bandwidth is low, and the delay in all aspects is slightly higher than that of MIPS. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),"14th International Conference on Cloud Computing, CLOUD 2021 held as Part of the Services Conference Federation, SCF 2021",10 December 2021 through 14 December 2021,"Virtual, Online",274099,,0,Final,

Fatigue study of an inverse-designed low induction rotor using open-source tools,,Major D.; Churchfield M.; Schmitz S.,2022,,Conference paper,10.1088/1742-6596/2265/4/042034,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131881682&doi=10.1088%2f1742-6596%2f2265%2f4%2f042034&partnerID=40&md5=1d3682d338a020358e51546d4ebf4b54,,"The current trend in wind turbine design leans toward increasing rotor diameter for increased energy capture. This presents a notable fatigue concern as blade loads increase with blade length. One solution to potentially alleviate the additional blade loading and improve the fatigue behavior of large-diameter wind turbines, while also reducing overall cost of energy, is the low-induction rotor. The purpose of this work is to perform a holistic analysis to assess the attainable benefits of a notional low-induction rotor variant of the DTU 10MW Reference Wind Turbine using multi-disciplinary open-source design and analysis tools. The notional low-induction rotor blade is designed using an inverse-design routine that allows for the direct specification of desired blade properties. To assess viability of the new rotor design, annual energy production and levelized cost of energy are considered along with fatigue at the blade root and the associated drivetrain and tower response to changes in blade loading. It is estimated that the proposed early-concept low-induction rotor design improves annual energy production by 6.35% (or 3 GW-h), resulting in a 4% (0.25 ¢/kW-h) reduction in levelized cost of energy. The low-thrust nature of the low-induction rotor design reduces root flap bending moment fatigue by up to 21.5%, and it is proposed that changes in blade root edgewise fatigue for the longer, heavier blades of the low-induction rotor can be alleviated with mass redistribution.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",Journal of Physics: Conference Series,"2022 Science of Making Torque from Wind, TORQUE 2022",1 June 2022 through 3 June 2022,Delft,179851,,0,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access

Yet, the state-of-the-art estimation techniques' accuracy has room for improvement. In this paper, we present a new approach for SP estimation, based on analysing textual features of software issues by employing latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and clustering. We first use LDA to represent issue reports in a new space of generated topics. We then use hierarchical clustering to agglomerate issues into clusters based on their topic similarities. Next, we build estimation models using the issues in each cluster. Then, we find the closest cluster to the new coming issue and use the model from that cluster to estimate the SP. Our approach is evaluated on a dataset of 26 open source projects with a total of 31,960 issues and compared against both baselines and state-of-the-art SP estimation techniques. The results show that the estimation performance of our proposed approach is as good as the state-of-the-art. However, none of these approaches is statistically significantly better than more naive estimators in all cases, which does not justify their additional complexity. We therefore encourage future work to develop alternative strategies for story points estimation. The experimental data and scripts we used in this work are publicly available to allow for replication and extension.  © 2022 IEEE.","Proceedings - 2022 IEEE International Conference on Software Analysis, Evolution and Reengineering, SANER 2022","29th IEEE International Conference on Software Analysis, Evolution and Reengineering, SANER 2022",15 March 2022 through 18 March 2022,"Virtual, Online",181173,IEEE Computer Society,4,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access

The effect of having the catalysts near the flame on the flame structure and pollutant emission is studied. To solve the problem, ReactingFOAM solver of OpenFOAM platform is used. OpenFOAM is an open-source CFD software that use object-oriented C++ custom-written codes. The ReactingFOAM uses PISO and Simple coupled algorithm method to solve the governing equations. Results indicated that the emission of NO2 is influenced, considerably by the presence of platinum near the lean, stoichiometric, and rich flame. It is also found that the presence of rhodium at the vicinity of the counterflow flame leads to a decrease in the CO formation for the flame with equivalence ratio of 0.7, 1, and 1.3 by 63, 18, and about 0%, respectively. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Combustion Science and Technology,,,,,,0,Article in press,
Story points changes in agile iterative development: An empirical study and a prediction approach,,Pasuksmit J.; Thongtanunam P.; Karunasekera S.,2022,,Article,10.1007/s10664-022-10192-9,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135800112&doi=10.1007%2fs10664-022-10192-9&partnerID=40&md5=8f955b2b44f161873cc359e93c039c9d,Mining software repositories; Software effort estimation; Story points,"Story Points (SP) are an effort unit that is used to represent the relative effort of a work item. In Agile software development, SP allows a development team to estimate their delivery capacity and facilitate the sprint planning activities. Although Agile embraces changes, SP changes after the sprint planning may negatively impact the sprint plan. To minimize the impact, there is a need to better understand the SP changes and an automated approach to predict the SP changes. Hence, to better understand the SP changes, we examine the prevalence, accuracy, and impact of information changes on SP changes. Through the analyses based on 19,349 work items spread across seven open-source projects, we find that on average, 10% of the work items have SP changes. These work items typically have SP value increased by 58%-100% relative to the initial SP value when they were assigned to a sprint. We also find that the unchanged SP reflect the development time better than the changed SP. Our qualitative analysis shows that the work items with changed SP often have the information changes relating to updating the scope of work. Our empirical results suggest that SP and the scope of work should be reviewed prior or during sprint planning to achieve a reliable sprint plan. Yet, it could be a tedious task to review all work items in the product (or sprint) backlog. Therefore, we develop a classifier to predict whether a work item will have SP changes after being assigned to a sprint. Our classifier achieves an AUC of 0.69-0.8, which is significantly better than the baselines. Our results suggest that to better manage and prepare for the unreliability in SP estimation, the team can leverage our insights and the classifier during the sprint planning. To facilitate future studies, we provide the replication package and the datasets, which are available online. © 2022, The Author(s).",Empirical Software Engineering,,,,,,1,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access

Microservices are distributed, independent and polyglot entities - all features favouring black-box testing. However, for real-scale MSA, a pure black-box strategy may not be able to exercise the system to properly cover the interactions involving internal microservices.We propose a grey-box strategy (MACROHIVE) for automated testing and monitoring of (internal) microservices interactions. It uses combinatorial testing to generate valid and invalid tests from microservices specification. Tests execution and monitoring are automated by a service mesh infrastructure. MACROHIVE runs the tests and traces the interactions among microservices, to report about internal coverage and failing behaviour.MACROHIVE is experimented on TrainTicket, an open-source MSA benchmark. It performs comparably to state-of-the-art techniques in terms of edge-level coverage, but exposes internal failures undetected by black-box testing, gives detailed internal coverage information, and requires fewer tests.  © 2022 IEEE.","IEEE International Conference on Software Quality, Reliability and Security, QRS","22nd IEEE International Conference on Software Quality, Reliability and Security, QRS 2022",5 December 2022 through 9 December 2022,"Virtual, Online",187416,,0,Final,

From an open-source high-throughput screening (HTS) database of 300 OCM catalysts made by random sampling from a materials space, the top 10 three-element-supported catalysts with C2yield higher than 11.0% and C2selectivity higher than 80.0% at CH4/O2= 6.0 were selected as targets for modification. Then, ML-aided investigation of an additive fourth element as a promoter was performed at the SVR field based on the HTS database among 350 catalysts (40,330 data points). Application of one-hot encoding to ascertain positive elements for CH4conversion revealed that manganese (Mn) frequently appears at CH4conversion higher than 44.0%. After the 10 selected catalysts were prepared with the Mn additive, their OCM performance was compared with those of pristine three-element-supported catalysts. Results show that four catalysts represent positive features on C2yield in the presence of additive Mn working as a promoter. Consequently, 5 wt % Mn-loaded LiFeBa/La2O3and LiBaLa/La2O3, respectively, show attractive OCM performance of 16.3% C2yield with 88.4% selectivity and 13.8% C2yield with 71.9% selectivity, even under an O2-lean condition (CH4/O2= 6.0). © 2022 American Chemical Society.

The first is called 'Motivate yourself', which contains videos and motivational phrases to publicize the experiences of successful and empowered women who have studied STEM. On the other hand, the second module, 'Learn while playing', provides us with various interactive games that test their knowledge to enrich the girls' learning about STEM-related topics. These modules were created based on the M-Learning method that focuses on learning through digital platforms. While for the application's architecture, the Scrum methodology is used, which is based on fulfilling tasks with a development team for short periods called 'Sprints,' using the open-source software React Native with its JavaScript programming language.

This continuous shift of the lean operation limit entails questions on the applicability limits of the combustion models used to date for SI engine design and optimization. In this work, an assessment of flamelet-based models, widely used in RANS SI engines simulations of premixed turbulent combustion, is carried out using an open-source 3D-CFD platform to clarify the applicability limits on HULP mixtures. Two different consolidated approaches are selected: the Coherent Flame Model (CFM) and the Flame Area Model (FAM). Both methodologies are embedded by the authors into the same numerical structure and compared against measurements over a simplified and controlled flame configuration, which is representative of engine-like conditions. The experimental steady-state flame of type “A” of the Darmstadt Turbulent Stratified Flame (TSF) burner is selected for the assessment. This configuration is characterized by flame measurements over a strong shear and mixing layer between the central high-speed CH (Formula presented.) -air jet and the surrounding slow air co-flow, hence, it represents an interesting controlled condition to study turbulent HULP mixtures. A comparison between computed results and experimental data on trends of mean flow velocity, turbulence, temperature and mixture stratification was carried out. This enabled us to assess that the investigated flamelet-based combustion models failed in providing accurate and reliable results when the flame approaches turbulent HULP mixture conditions, demonstrating the urgency to develop models able to fill this gap. © 2022 by the authors.",Energies,,,,,,2,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access

Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models provide realistic descriptions of xenobiotics’ absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion processes. They model the body as a set of homogeneous compartments representing organs, and their parameters refer to anatomical, physiological, biochemical, and physicochemical entities. They offer a quantitative mechanistic framework to understand and simulate the time-course of the concentration of a substance in various organs and body fluids. These models are well suited for performing extrapolations inherent to toxicology and pharmacology (e.g., between species or doses) and for integrating data obtained from various sources (e.g., in vitro or in vivo experiments, structure–activity models). In this chapter, we describe the practical development and basic use of a PBPK model from model building to model simulations, through implementation with an easily accessible free software. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Methods in Molecular Biology,,,,,,0,Final,
DeltaFuzz: Historical Version Information Guided Fuzz Testing,,Zhang J.-M.; Cui Z.-Q.; Chen X.; Wu H.-H.; Zheng L.-W.; Liu J.-B.,2022,20,Article,10.1007/s11390-021-1663-7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125335128&doi=10.1007%2fs11390-021-1663-7&partnerID=40&md5=08567c793d13007af87dab3b0268b2a1,change impact analysis; fitness function; fuzz testing; regression testing,"With the widespread use of agile software development methods, such as agile and scrum, software is iteratively updated more frequently. To ensure the quality of the software, regression testing is conducted before new versions are released. Moreover, to improve the efficiency of regression testing, testing efforts should be concentrated on the modified and impacted parts of a program. However, the costs of manually constructing new test cases for the modified and impacted parts are relatively expensive. Fuzz testing is an effective method for generating test data automatically, but it is usually devoted to achieving higher code coverage, which makes fuzz testing unsuitable for direct regression testing scenarios. For this reason, we propose a fuzz testing method based on the guidance of historical version information. First, the differences between the program being tested and the last version are analyzed, and the results of the analysis are used to locate change points. Second, change impact analysis is performed to find the corresponding impacted basic blocks. Finally, the fitness values of test cases are calculated according to the execution traces, and new test cases are generated iteratively by the genetic algorithm. Based on the proposed method, we implement a prototype tool DeltaFuzz and conduct experiments on six open-source projects. Compared with the fuzzing tool AFLGo, AFLFast and AFL, DeltaFuzz can reach the target faster, and the time taken by DeltaFuzz was reduced by 20.59%, 30.05% and 32.61%, respectively. © 2022, Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.",Journal of Computer Science and Technology,,,,,,1,Final,

Conceived to break the ""has never flown, will never fly"" cycle, the spacecraft has spearheaded many firsts, one of which is a new paradigm to on-board software by introducing the concept of ""apps"" in space. These apps can be easily developed, debugged, tested, deployed, and updated at any time without causing major problems to the spacecraft. Apps run on an embedded 32-bit distribution of Linux on top of the Satellite Experimental Processing Platform (SEPP); a powerful processor with sufficient on-board memory to carry out advanced software and hardware experiments. The SEPP’s compute power and Linux operating system opens the door to open-source software reuse within the realms of Python, Java, C, C++, and BusyBox. During LEOP and Commissioning, the Flight Control Team (FCT) quickly learned how to leverage this enabling environment for operational purposes. Open-source software libraries and frameworks originally developed for terrestrial applications in mobile, embedded, and Internet of Things devices have been reused in apps and procedures deployed to the spacecraft. Apps that build on top of open technologies with strong industry heritage significantly reduce implementation and validation efforts while allowing for more sophisticated solutions to be developed. This paper presents case studies on how the FCT leveraged open-source technologies to bring their software ideas from concept to in-flight operations in a matter of a few weeks; effectively introducing Agile best practices and rapid prototyping to a flying mission’s on-board software development process. © 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

SwarmMap: Scaling Up Real-time Collaborative Visual SLAM at the Edge,,Xu J.; Cao H.; Yang Z.; Shangguan L.; Zhang J.; He X.; Liu Y.,2022,16,Conference paper,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85140883975&partnerID=40&md5=6aba34187d5ae0df3b4db901b81119f8,,"The Edge-based Multi-agent visual SLAM plays a key role in emerging mobile applications such as search-and-rescue, inventory automation, and industrial inspection. This algorithm relies on a central node to maintain the global map and schedule agents to execute their individual tasks. However, as the number of agents continues growing, the operational overhead of the visual SLAM system such as data redundancy, bandwidth consumption, and localization errors also scale, which challenges the system scalability. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of SwarmMap, a framework design that scales up collaborative visual SLAM service in edge offloading settings. At the core of SwarmMap are three simple yet effective system modules - a change log-based server-client synchronization mechanism, a priority-aware task scheduler, and a lean representation of the global map that work hand-in-hand to address the data explosion caused by the growing number of agents. We make SwarmMap compatible with the robotic operating system (ROS) and open-source it. Existing visual SLAM applications could incorporate SwarmMap to enhance their performance and capacity in multi-agent scenarios. Comprehensive evaluations and a three-month case study at one of the world's largest oil fields demonstrate that SwarmMap can serve 2× more agents (>20 agents) than the state of the arts with the same resource overhead, meanwhile maintaining an average trajectory error of 38cm, outperforming existing works by >55%. © 2022 by The USENIX Association.

In order to understand the dynamic characteristics of lean premixed flame and predict and control its combustion instability, it is necessary to obtain its flame describing function (FDF). Based on the open source CFD toolbox, OpenFOAM, the dynamic K-equation model, and the finite rate Partially Stirred Reactor (PaSR) model were used to perform large eddy simulations (LES) of lean premixed combustion, and the response of the unsteady heat release rate to single-frequency harmonic disturbances was studied. The response of the unsteady heat release rate was characterized by the FDF, and the response of the unsteady heat release rate to the two-frequency harmonic disturbance was studied. The results show that the quantitative heat release rate response and flame dynamics have very proper accuracy. In the single-frequency harmonic disturbance, as the forcing frequency increases, the curling behavior of the flame surface and the instantaneous vortex structure change; the nonlinear kinematics effect is manifested by the entrainment of the vortex. At lower forcing frequencies, the heat release response changes linearly with the increase of forcing amplitude; at intermediate frequencies, the heat release response exhibits obvious nonlinear behavior; at high frequencies, the heat release response to amplitude changes decreases. The introduction of the second harmonic disturbance will significantly reduce the response range of the total heat release rate and make the combustion more stable. © IMechE 2021.","Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part G: Journal of Aerospace Engineering",,,,,,0,Final,

Aims: In this paper, we aim to shed further light on the relationship between SP and Agile software development effort to understand the extent to which human-estimated SP is a good indicator of user story development effort expressed in terms of time needed to realise it. Method: To this end, we carry out a thorough empirical study involving a total of 37,440 unique user stories from 37 different open-source projects publicly available in the TAWOS dataset. For these user stories, we investigate the correlation between the issue development time (or its approximation when the actual time is not available) and the SP estimated by human-expert by using three widely-used correlation statistics (i.e., Pearson, Kendall and Spearman). Furthermore, we investigate SP estimations made by the human-experts in order to assess the extent to which they are consistent in their estimations throughout the project, i.e., we assess whether the development time of the issues is proportionate to the SP assigned to them. Results: The average results across the three correlation measures reveal that the correlation between the human-expert estimated SP and the approximated development time is strong for only 7% of the projects investigated, and medium (58%) or low (35%) for the remaining ones. Similar results are obtained when the actual development time is considered. Our empirical study also reveals that the estimation made is often not consistent throughout the project and the human estimator tends to misestimate in 78% of the cases. Conclusions: Our empirical results suggest that SP might not be an accurate indicator of opensource Agile software development effort expressed in terms of development time. The impact of its use as an indicator of effort should be explored in future work, for example as a cost-driver in automated effort estimation models or as the prediction target.  © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.",International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement,"16th ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement, ESEM 2022",18 September 2022 through 23 September 2022,Helsinki,182874,,2,Final,

This can be challenging due to the unique needs of scientific software, the insufficient resources for software engineering practices in the scientific community, and the complexity of developing for evolving scientific contexts. While open-source software can partially address these concerns, it can introduce complicating dependencies and delay development. These issues can be reduced if scientists and software developers collaborate. We present a case study wherein scientists from the SuperNova Early Warning System collaborated with software developers from the Scalable Cyberinfrastructure for Multi-Messenger Astrophysics project. The collaboration addressed the difficulties of open-source software development, but presented additional risks to each team. For the scientists, there was a concern of relying on external systems and lacking control in the development process. For the developers, there was a risk in supporting a user-group while maintaining core development. These issues were mitigated by creating a second Agile Scrum framework in parallel with the developers' ongoing Agile Scrum process. This Agile collaboration promoted communication, ensured that the scientists had an active role in development, and allowed the developers to evaluate and implement the scientists' software requirements. The collaboration provided benefits for each group: the scientists actuated their development by using an existing platform, and the developers utilized the scientists' use-case to improve their systems. This case study suggests that scientists and software developers can avoid scientific computing issues by collaborating and that Agile Scrum methods can address emergent concerns. © 2022 The Authors.

Often, datasets are too large to practically be stored on a laptop or a workstation. The ability to query metadata collections without retrieving complete datasets is therefore critical to efficiently perform new analyses and explore the data. At the same time, new experimental paradigms lead to constantly changing specifications for the metadata to be stored. Despite this, there is currently a serious lack of agile software tools for data management in neuroscience laboratories. To meet this need, we have developed Expipe, a lightweight data management framework that simplifies the steps from experiment to data analysis. Expipe provides the functionality to store and organize experimental data and metadata for easy retrieval in exploration and analysis throughout the experimental pipeline. It is flexible in terms of defining the metadata to store and aims to solve the storage and retrieval challenges of data/metadata due to ever changing experimental pipelines. Due to its simplicity and lightweight design, we envision Expipe as an easy-to-use data management solution for experimental laboratories, that can improve provenance, reproducibility, and sharing of scientific projects. © Copyright © 2020 Lepperød, Dragly, Buccino, Mobarhan, Malthe-Sørenssen, Hafting and Fyhn.",Frontiers in Neuroinformatics,,,,,,4,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access

In this paper we present our research tool FASTEN.Safe, which extends GSN with a set of higher-level modeling language constructs capturing recurring argumentation patterns and integrating formal system models. This allows automatically checking 1) the intrinsic consistency of assurance models, 2) the consistency of arguments with system models and 3) the verification of safety claims themselves by using external verification tools.

The first step is to use Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to decompose matrix gene expression data into two global-based gene and condition matrices. The second step is to use Partition around Medoid (PAM) to cluster gene and condition-based matrices using Euclidean distance, forming several biclusters that were further evaluated using the Modified Lift Algorithm based on Pearson correlation, which is a very appropriate method to detect an additive-multiplicative bicluster type. The algorithm processes are run using open-source R software. The resulting biclusters of the proposed algorithm having a strong correlation among genes and samples are obtained so that the method has high potential in future medical research.

This paper discusses the process and some details of infusing sustainability into a Quality Management course during Spring 2020 term. Although the main topic of the course is not sustainability, objectives were added for the sustainability component of the course. The purpose of this undertaking is to help students understand the role engineering profession plays in sustainability, to create awareness, interest, and commitment to ESD, and to make the connection between lean, green Six Sigma and ESD. Sustainability resources include instructor lectures, journal articles, blogs and podcasts, TED Talks, and open-source videos. Course activities that engage students in the topic are several group discussions, a quiz, instructional videos, and an opportunity to develop a systems diagram and later work within a group to consolidate and expand the diagram based on contributions from the team. Additionally, the course project gives student an option to adopt a topic related to sustainability. To inform the decision of whether the sustainability infusion in this course should be continued in future semesters, informal feedback surveys from students was collected to determine efficacy, interest, and satisfaction level.

It is adopted by the software development community a long time ago and now several methodologies based on agile principles have become established as a method of software development. These agile based software development methodologies have developed as an integral part of the software engineering and software development curricula for many computing degree courses. One such agile based methodology is Scrum which is widely used in the software industry and thus in teaching. Several agile Scrum tools are available for software development, however, for teaching and learning purposes, this would not be affordable for many institutions due to its cost or learning curve. This necessitates the requirement for a free or open-source Scrum tool without any learning curve. Trello which is a free project management and collaborative working tool but not particularly designed for Scrum. However, its functionality and features can be transformed to make it a basic Scrum tool for teaching and learning purposes at no cost. This paper presents a systematic development and application of Trello-based agile Scrum methodology not just for teaching and learning purposes but for real project development. It is employed in the delivery of the software engineering module in BSc courses and subsequently, in the development of the BSc final year project at Bournemouth University, UK. This implementation of Trello-based agile Scrum methodology in the project development is compared against the simple agile Scrum based project development practice to demonstrate the success and learning improvement of this proposed methodology. © 2020, Crown.",Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,"13th International Conference on Complex, Intelligent, and Software Intensive Systems, CISIS 2019",3 July 2019 through 5 July 2019,Sydney,227709,,7,Final,
Maintainability of Automatic Acceptance Tests for Web Applications—A Case Study Comparing Two Approaches to Organizing Code of Test Cases,,Sadaj A.; Ochodek M.; Kopczyńska S.; Nawrocki J.,2020,12,Conference paper,10.1007/978-3-030-38919-2_37,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85079085768&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-38919-2_37&partnerID=40&md5=43da3341f7f92d40f7d05cd35f5758cf,Acceptance testing; Cucumber; Keyword-driven testing; Linear scripting; Selenium; Web applications,"[Context] Agile software development calls for test automation since it is critical for continuous development and delivery. However, automation is a challenging task especially for tests of user interface, which can be very expensive. [Problem] There are two extreme approaches of structuring the code of test duties for web-applicating, i.e., linear scripting and keyword-driven scripting technique employing the page object pattern. The goal of this research is to compare them focusing on the maintainability aspect. [Method] We develop and maintain two automatic test suites implementing the same test cases for a mature open-source system using these two approaches. For each approach, we measure the size of the testing codebase and the number of lines of code that need to be modified to keep the test suites passing and valid through five releases of the system. [Results] We observed that the total number of physical lines was higher for the keyword-driven approach than for the linear scripting one. However, the number of programmatical lines of code was smaller for the former. The number of lines of code that had to be modified to maintain the tests was lower for the keyword-driven scripting test suite than for the linear-scripting one. We found the linear-scripting technique was more difficult to maintain because the scripts consist only of low-level code directly interacting with a web browser making it hard to understand the purpose and broader context of the interaction they implement. [Conclusions] We conclude that test suites created using the keyword-driven approach are easier to maintain and more suitable for most of the projects. However, the results show that the linear scripting approach could be considered as a less expensive alternative for small projects that are not likely to be frequently modified in the future. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),"46th International Conference on Current Trends in Theory and Practice of Computer Science, SOFSEM 2020",20 January 2020 through 24 January 2020,Limassol,236569,,0,Final,

It was developed to be used as a guide to support professors or specialists for decision making, selection of teaching materials according to the participants' cognitive learning for the execution of subjects or teaching units on topics related to software testing. In addition to suggesting several personalized activities, presenting an instance of application of a teaching syllabus that adheres to several reference syllabus, this model also seeks to be extensible, to be applied in other teaching areas, trying not to be limited to the software testing area. The construction of this model makes use of practical teaching approaches supported by practices, such as gamification and playful teaching to motivate and engage participants, bringing common tasks and technologies in the software industry in parallel to classic lecture classes, in order to develop certain skills, which were obtained through academic syllabus, together with technical skills in software testing for participants, in addition to knowledge of several open source tools that are used by testing professionals in the software industry. This construction is specified in several stages arranged in a teaching cycle, being sequenced when they are applied and can be adapted for other learning scenarios. Subsequently, the skills, competences and support materials that can be used are presented in addition to the possible effects expected on students from the application of this model in the teaching of software testing. As it uses practical teaching approaches, it is advisable that this model is used by professors who have a teaching facilitator profile, as it presents humanistic teaching learning, with a focus on participants and teamwork, principles found in agile methods, in which activities will have deliveries of products that approach what is performed in a software company and it will be necessary the interaction of all participants in the model. The evaluation process for this teaching model took place in two stages. First, there was an analysis and individual evaluation of the model through the questionnaire, then there was a consensus meeting between the evaluators, where they justified the marks attributed in the evaluation and their considerations on other responses. This meeting aimed to solve disagreements and collect opinions, enabling problems to be solved and reaching a final consensus among the evaluators. The authors consider that it is necessary to remodel teaching paradigms of computing subjects, using together some characteristics of traditional approaches with more practical teaching approaches that solidify the knowledge of the participants for the challenges that exist in the software industry. © 2020 IEEE.","Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE","2020 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE 2020",21 October 2020 through 24 October 2020,Uppsala,165647,"American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE), Educational Research and Methods Division (ERM); IEEE Computer Society; IEEE Education Society",7,Final,

Open-source software (OSS) and cloud technologies are taking up business innovation and DevOps at new heights. However, in the quest of agility and velocity, user data security and privacy assurance often get lower priority as they are perceived as a time-consuming activity requiring specialized people, process, and technology. We see this problem being addressed by integrating security in DevOps processes. Security for DevOps has been institutionalized as DevSecOps with practical considerations for a given business context. In this work, we proposed a conceptual security model, ADOC, to facilitate adopting DevSecOps for the business processes capitalizing OSS over the cloud. This work contributes towards the following to integrate continuous security in application and service delivery: (i) A continuous security conceptual framework proposal based on the requirements elicited from the analysis of challenges in adopting DevSecOps using OSS over the cloud. (ii) An integrationist security model, ADOC, based on the proposed continuous security conceptual framework, integrating development, security, and operation activities through automation of security controls using OSS over the cloud. (iii) A set of inter-working OSS tools for automation of the proposed security controls in ADOC workflow and practices. (iv) A set of metrics for performance measurement of the ADOC model. (v) Mapping of the solutions for the analyzed challenges using the proposed security controls, followed by a use case scenario to adopt the ADOC workflow and continuous practices. The ADOC transforms security being adhoc compliance-oriented activities into continuous assurance-oriented activities by codifying security controls into an automated delivery workflow. Its practical adoption enables businesses to deliver time-to-market security ready applications and services with accelerated velocity and sustainable agility in a cost-effective way. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Computers and Security,,,,,,22,Final,
On the liquid condensate vertical migration near the production wells of gas-condensate reservoirs,,Salmani N.; Fatehi R.; Azin R.,2020,7,Article,10.1016/j.jestch.2020.03.006,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85083017533&doi=10.1016%2fj.jestch.2020.03.006&partnerID=40&md5=55b9c20dc3a6f218a8633cb84e0c4c69,Condensate blockage; Gas-condensate reservoir; Gravity effect; Modified Black-Oil model; Vertical flow,"Accumulation of liquids in gas-condensate reservoirs may lead to a vertical flow of liquid caused by density difference in the presence of gravity. In this paper, the effect of this vertical flow on the prediction of production data has been investigated. To achieve this goal, a single-layer synthetic cylindrical reservoir is considered and, the flows are simulated with and without vertical direction grid blocks with two lean and rich fluids. The governing equations of the so-called Modified Black-Oil (MBO) model are solved in a cylinder sector using the open-source Matlab Reservoir Simulation Toolbox (MRST). When the vertical flow is taken into consideration, the results show that gravity may lead to migration of liquid condensates to lower regions and the production rates decrease as a consequence of wellbore partially blockage especially for the rich fluid. In addition, gravity may cause a non-linear effect on the flow behavior and increase in the condensates production rates. All results are also obtained for three values of critical liquid condensate saturation to show the effect of this parameter on the production. It has been shown that neglecting the vertical flow may cause significant errors in the result of production, i.e. up to 25% when the fluid is rich and the critical condensate saturation is 0.15. To generalize the effect of the reservoir thickness, dimensional analysis is carried out which yields a similarity parameter. The findings of this study can help for a better understanding of near well flow in gas-condensate reservoirs. Based on this study, in applications in which the reservoir gas is rich in condensate and the thickness of the reservoir layer or the vertical permeability is high enough, it is recommended that the gravity effect is taken into account by enough grid points in the vertical direction in each layer. © 2020 Karabuk University","Engineering Science and Technology, an International Journal",,,,,,3,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access

Supervised machine learning is applied in this study to provide optimum prediction model. All the available regression models in Matlab R2019b are used to predict number of team members required for an agile project. Iterations from five different open source projects are considered for this study.

Many factors, ranging from team size to music listened by developers, have been studied regarding their effect on productivity. Surprisingly, little is known about how the dynamics of open-source projects that use agile practices are related to the productivity of the developer teams. Our study aims to close this gap by analyzing the productivity of open-source projects using measures that are popular in the context of agile software development. To do this, we study data from seven open-source projects and calculated both the individual velocity of developers and focus factor of teams per iteration. First, we applied statistical process control to identify iterations with out-of-control velocity and focus factor values. Then, we studied these iterations regarding four context factors that partly characterize the dynamics of open-source projects, i.e., iteration length, turnover of developers who left, turnover of new developers, and team stability index. Our results suggest that high team stability and low turnover are strongly associated with iterations showing high velocity.  © 2020 IEEE.","Proceedings - 46th Euromicro Conference on Software Engineering and Advanced Applications, SEAA 2020","46th Euromicro Conference on Software Engineering and Advanced Applications, SEAA 2020",26 August 2020 through 28 August 2020,Kranj,164145,,7,Final,

Reusable Learning Objects have actually been discussed in the literature for the last 20 years and yet true large scale sharing of learning and teaching materials remains relatively rare and challenging. This paper argues that part of the reason is that the granularity of the learning objects that are in use today is not conducive to true reuse. Certainly whole PowerPoint slide decks and word documents are kept in individuals' folders; perhaps bits are cut and pasted and emailed around; but providence, permissions, tracking and tracing are ad-hoc and styling, formatting, templates, slide layouts need to be tended to repeatedly. It is not an ideal situation. As a result, educators, teachers, course designers, are constantly reinventing the wheel, or searching for where that one excellent assignment, explanation, definition was last seen so it can be copied forward.This paper argues that to achieve effective reuse of Learning Objects, the following are required: smaller, more granular (micro) learning objects; means to combine them into larger presentation products; and modern revision and version control. The paper proposes applying approaches originating in the software engineering community, such as agile methodology, version control and management, markup languages, and agile publishing, which together form the Agile Approach of the title of the paper. With that foundation laid, the paper examines CourseGen, an open source software platform designed for creating, sharing, reusing and publishing reusable course content. CourseGen uses a modified markdown format augmented by CourseGen specific directives, such as link to and include topic. The CourseGen compiler converts a collection of CourseGen files into the final format such as a web site or a PowerPoint.

In sprint planning, the team develops product functionality to fulfill the selected product backlog items. In order to implement the product functionality, the team plans needed activities and then decomposes the activities into tasks. When dependent tasks are assigned to different developers, there is need for coordination between developers. The needs of coordination are difficult to quantify, however, quantification of the needs of coordination is an important factor to accurately estimate team performance of a sprint. In this paper, a method is proposed to calculate distribution of task dependency among developers, and the distribution is defined as Coordination Needs. An experiment on an open source project, Spring, demonstrates that the Coordination Needs is strongly correlated with team performance. With the method, the Coordination Needs of task allocation is revealed so team performance of a sprint can be accurately estimated, and task allocation can be optimized.  © 2020 IEEE.","Proceedings - 2020 International Computer Symposium, ICS 2020","2020 International Computer Symposium, ICS 2020",17 December 2020 through 19 December 2020,Tainan,167420,Cisco; et al.; Fortinet; Logicalis Architects of Change; NARLabs - National Center for High-Performance Computing (NCHC); NetApp,1,Final,

We can view Gordon Moore's observation on transistor densification as just one aspect of a longer-term underlying technological trend - the Law of Accelerating Returns articulated by Kurzweil. Arguably, companies became somewhat complacent in the Moore era, happy to settle for the gains brought by each new process node. Although we can expect scaling to continue, albeit at a slower pace, the end of Moore's Law delivers a stronger incentive to push other trends of technology progress harder. Some exciting new technologies are now emerging such as multichip 3D integration and the introduction of new technologies such as storage-class memory and silicon photonics. Moreover, we are also entering a golden age of computer architecture innovation. One of the key drivers is the pursuit of domain-specific architectures as proclaimed by Turing award winners John Hennessy and David Patterson. A good example is the Xilinx's AI Engine, one of the important features of the Versal™ ACAP (adaptive compute acceleration platform) [1]. Today, the explosion of AI workloads is one of the most powerful drivers shifting our attention to find faster ways of moving data into, across, and out of accelerators. Features such as massive parallel processing elements, the use of domain specific accelerators, the dense interconnect between distributed on-chip memories and processing elements, are examples of the ways chip makers are looking beyond scaling to achieve next-generation performance gains. Next, the growing demands of scaling-out hyperscale datacenter applications drive much of the new architecture developments. Given a high diversification of workloads that invoke massive compute and data movement, datacenter architectures are moving away from rigid CPU-centric structures and instead prioritize adaptability and configurability to optimize resources such as memory and connectivity of accelerators assigned to individual workloads. There is no longer a single figure of merit. It's not all about Tera-OPS. Other metrics such as transfers-per-second and latency come to the fore as demands become more real-time; autonomous vehicles being an obvious and important example. Moreover, the transition to 5G will result in solutions that operate across the traditional boundaries between the cloud and edge and embedded platforms that are obviously power-conscious and cost-sensitive. Future workloads will require agile software flows that accommodate the spread of functions across edge and cloud. Another industry megatrend that will drive technology requirements especially in encryption, data storage and communication, is Blockchain. To some, it may already have a bad reputation, tarnished by association with the anarchy of cryptocurrency, but it will be more widely relevant than many of us realize. Who could have foreseen the development of today's Internet when ARPANET first appeared as a simple platform for distributed computing and sending email? Through projects such as the open-source Hyperledger, Blockchain technology could be game-changing as a platform for building trust in transactions executed over the Internet. We may soon be talking in terms of the Trusted Internet. The predictability of Moore's law may have become rather too comfortable and slow. The future requires maximizing the flexibility, agility, and efficiency of new technologies. With Moore's Law now mostly behind us, new adaptable and scalable architectures will allow us to further provide exponential return from technology in order to create a more adaptable and intelligent world. © 2020 Copyright held by the owner/author.",Proceedings of the International Symposium on Physical Design,"23rd International Symposium on Physical Design, ISPD 2020",29 March 2020 through 1 April 2020,Taipei,158533,ACM Special Interest Group on Design Automation (ACM SIGDA),1,Final,
Soil and water assessment tool (Swat) for modeling and simulation in water resources engineering,,Nda M.; Adnan M.S.; M Yusoff M.A.; Jiya G.S.; Ebenehi I.Y.,2020,,Conference paper,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096512263&partnerID=40&md5=4155878435e5be22cdcf578676d40c17,Hydrologic modeling; Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT); Water resources management,"In recent times there is a continuous influence by climate change and human activities on the environment giving rise to hydrological focus research. Hydrologic modeling tools are employed to examine various practical issues arising from planning, design, operation, and management of water resources systems. These include physical, empirical, stochastic, distributed models and open-source watershed models such as Info Works River Simulation (IWRS), Stormwater Management Model (XP-SWMM), Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), Kinematic Runoff and Erosion Model Software (KINEROS), Long-Term Hydrologic Impact Analysis (L-THIA) and River Analysis System (HEC-RAS). From the models mentioned, SWAT is a typical distributed model widely used in analyzing and forecasting several complex hydrologic variables. This paper is aimed at providing an overview of SWAT and its applicability in hydrological modeling. © IEOM Society International.",Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management,"Proceedings of the 5th NA International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management, IOEM 2020",10 August 2020 through 14 August 2020,Virtual,144118,CINTAS; EATON Powering Business worldwide; EFR Certification; SIEMENS; ToolingTechGroup,1,Final,
SymPlot: A Web-Tool to Visualise Symbolic Musical Data,,Munoz-Lago P.; Llorens A.; Parada-Cabaleiro E.; Torrente A.,2020,6,Conference paper,10.1109/IV51561.2020.00092,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85102933267&doi=10.1109%2fIV51561.2020.00092&partnerID=40&md5=bb89c83831b5ff3c4517cde8e2686f1b,computational musicology; data science; digital humanities; music; score; symbolic music data; visualisation,"Some complex musical parameters might be especially difficult to understand for someone with no theoretical expertise in music. Musicians and music scholars alike normally evaluate such parameters visually by departing from scores, which present the musical events at once. Yet for the under-standing of such symbolic representations, musical training is essential, making scores mostly incomprehensible for amateurs. Data visualisation has been applied to meaningfully represent complex musical parameters, thus enabling music amateurs to grasp concepts such as texture or structure. Although scores are one of the ""primary""sources to understand music, previous work shows a strong bias towards the visualisation of acoustic data, in detriment of the visualisation of symbolic information. To bridge the gap, we present SymPlot, a web-based open source tool to automatically visualise textural density, scoring, and structure from MusicXML files. Due to the multidisciplinary nature of the topic, in this project we have applied the Scrum's agile methodology, an iterative incremental approach specifically tailored for interdisciplinary projects. The tool, aimed at enhancing musical understanding in amateurs and students, as well as in scholars of other disciplines who need to incorporate music into their discourses, i.e., historians, philologists, etc., enables visualisation of local features at various hierarchical levels, highlighting similarities both within and across scores. Our evaluation of SymPlot-based on a five-level rating-scale test performed by 50 participants-suggests that colours increase users' understanding of complex musical parameters. © 2020 IEEE.",Proceedings of the International Conference on Information Visualisation,"24th International Conference Information Visualisation, IV 2020",7 September 2020 through 11 September 2020,Melbourne,167837,,1,Final,
