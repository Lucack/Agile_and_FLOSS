TWINS - This Workflow Is Not Scrum: Agile Process Adaptation for Open Source Software Projects,,P. T. Robinson; S. Beecham,2019,9,IEEE Conferences,10.1109/ICSSP.2019.00014,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8812868,"agile software development, Scrum, open source software, Kanban, Scrumban","It is becoming commonplace for companies to contribute to open source software (OSS) projects. At the same time, many software organizations are applying Scrum software development practices, for productivity and quality gains. Scrum calls for self-organizing teams, in which the development team has total control over its development process. However, OSS projects typically have their own processes and standards, which might not mesh well with a company's internal processes, such as Scrum. This paper presents an experience report from Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE), where the ""toolchain CPU compiler"" team directly participates in the ""LLVM"" OSS project. The team ran into a number of difficulties when using Scrum to manage their development. In particular, the team often failed to complete Scrum sprints where tasks required interaction with the open source community. We look at how the team redefined task flows to alleviate these difficulties, and eventually evolved a highly modified process, dubbed TWINS (This Workflow Is Not Scrum). We assess the revised process, and compare it to other established agile methods, finding it bears a strong resemblance to Scrumban (the SIE team was not aware of Scrumban previously). The TWINS framework presented here may help other organizations who develop software in-house and engage in OSS projects, to gain the best of both worlds.",5,48,26-Aug-19,26-Aug-19,2019 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software and System Processes (ICSSP)
RapidRelease - A Dataset of Projects and Issues on Github with Rapid Releases,,S. D. Joshi; S.

Recent trends have reduced average release cycle lengths to as low as 1-2 weeks, leading to an extensive number of studies in release engineering. Open-source development (OSD) has also witnessed a rapid increase in release rates, however, no large dataset of open-source projects exists which features high release rates. In this paper, we introduce the RapidRelease dataset, a data showcase of high release frequency open-source projects. The dataset hosts 994 projects from Github, with over 2 million issue reports. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first dataset that can facilitate researchers to empirically study release engineering and agile software development in open-source projects with rapid releases.",4,16,29-Aug-19,29-Aug-19,2020 46th Euromicro Conference on Software Engineering and Advanced Applications (SEAA)
Open-Source Innovation in Practice: A Lean-Based Development Process Leveraging Open-Source Big Data Tools,,S. Alonso; M. Viana; E. Cirilo; P. Alencar; C.

However, building innovative products is becoming gradually more challenging because of increased market volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity. In our Innovation Lab, inside an e-Procurement Company, we encountered several challenges when implementing an innovation process to develop an initial unstructured data processing Minimum Viable Product (MVP) based on opensource big data tools: (i) raising and prioritizing user demands; (ii) deciding about adequate tools; and (iii) understanding how to promptly set up a viable product. In this paper, we share our open-source innovation experience in bringing novel solutions to an oil company's suppliers. In general, we present and discuss how we have been applying our innovation process to create MVPs, and which technical decision helped us accelerate the MVP development in the presence of a large-scale, unstructured database and open-source big data tools. Overall, we believe the proposed lean-based development process can help practitioners and researchers who want to understand and improve their knowledge about lean products, how to build MVPs, and advance open-source innovation involving big data tools.",,36,24-Feb-20,24-Feb-20,2019 IEEE/ACM 16th International Conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR)

Open source encourages innovation through collaboration, reduces Time-To-Market, and fuels breakthrough technologies from the past few decades. In a way, open source is eating software or driving the Software world. Open source communities involve more contributors /developers, sometimes posing substantial security challenges. Recently, we have witnessed SolarWinds compromising the entire supply chain, Log4j allowing access to execute code with critical zero-day vulnerability remotely. The digital universe paused because these zero-day vulnerabilities exploded as an outcome.

Agile software development is exceedingly difficult and has contentious issues in literature and business. Since most Agile techniques place more emphasis on development than software testing activities, different people have varying opinions about how software testing fits into these methodologies. Agile places a high emphasis on frequent deliveries and tight client connections. However, software testing is complex because agile does not incorporate many destructive testing techniques typically required for a product of higher-quality. The study reveals industry-wide Agile testing procedures and the main problems that arise when Agile development is used. Additionally covered are the differences between manual and automated testing, best automation practices, and ways to lead different testing teams in an agile testing environment. This study covers every facet of the Agile software testing process. Agile development has shown that testing is not a distinct stage but rather a crucial component of software development along with the coding. The agile team employs an overall strategy to produce software products of the highest quality. As part of an agile team, testers collect customer samples of the desired behaviour and collaborate with the developer's team to help the coders translate these examples into executable specifications. Coding and testing are done iteratively and incrementally, developing every item until it is valuable enough to release in production. It addresses several testing modalities. The classification provided by its quadrants aids teams in determining and organizing the necessary tests. To increase quality assurance, this article will examine various and improved Agile Testing Processes and methodologies. Additionally, the topic of Agile development's software testing method is covered. Agile development processes can be improved and more advantageous by incorporating testing procedures.",,17,24-Feb-23,24-Feb-23,2022 11th International Conference on System Modeling & Advancement in Research Trends (SMART)
Teaching an Undergraduate Software Engineering Course using Active Learning and Open Source Projects,,M. Dorodchi; E. Al-Hossami; M. Nagahisarchoghaei; R. S. Diwadkar; A.

The course is designed to be offered in the fourth or fifth semesters (i.e., end of sophomore or beginning of the junior year) for students who have completed the introductory programming and data structures courses. In addition, they may have some basic knowledge of databases and web technologies. Moreover, in our curriculum, students at this level have not been exposed to any codebase of real-world application and particularly of large size (>10,000 lines) codebases yet. Based on such situations, the major focus of this course is on teaching the fundamentals of software engineering as a methodology of developing real-world software with an emphasis on: 1) software systems in the enterprise level, 2) basic modeling using functional, flow, and behavioral diagrams, and 3) team-based agile project development. The paper discusses our novel course configuration of the three emphasized elements above, where students work with open source software in this class as part of course activities and assignments to simulate working on an enterprise project and learn agile development Our observation as well as our industry partners indicated that students enjoy the open source challenges and demonstrate professional competency after this course.

In conjunction with the increment of these methodology, amount of scientific research on this topic has also increased. This research concentrates on one component from Agile software development which is User Stories (US). In a recent paper, quality framework for User Stories was proposed together with a tool implementing which is still minimal finding to achieve high quality of user story document. It is closely related to the data requirement as part of the success factor in development project. The main goal is to analyze US requirement written and identification of potential errors in datasets that bring the effectiveness in forecasting the quality of User Stories for monitoring purpose. One of the steps require to identify the quality User Stories is by the route passing through data cleaning process. The research analysis considers performing data cleaning and pre-processing towards existing dataset of user story requirement from open-source agile software projects. Results of analyzing the User Stories will reveal the possibility step of data cleaning as initial step to extend the AQUSA tools and forecast the quality of User Stories. Thus, it can be related to the requirements quality based on the number of issues report in the dataset where highest number of issues report can be categorized as poor requirement statement.",,16,17-Sep-21,17-Sep-21,2021 International Conference on Software Engineering & Computer Systems and 4th International Conference on Computational Science and Information Management (ICSECS-ICOCSIM)

However, this approach is unfit for the more software-intensive world that is increasingly iterative, connected, and constantly online. Many constraints prevent the application of iterative, incremental, and agile development methodologies, which now are the norm for many other fields of software. Time-consuming system validation can only start when both hardware and software components are ready, which implies that the software delivery and quality is almost always the final bottleneck in the CPS development and integration. Also organizational issues raise concerns - CPS development teams are nowadays often geographically distributed, which can result in delays in the process, shortcomings, and even mistakes. In this paper, we propose using our envisioned open-source Virtual Reality-based Integrated software Development Environment (VRIDE) for developing the next generation, increasingly software-intensive CPSs in efficient ways.",1,21,21 nov. 2019,21 nov. 2019,2020 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)

A pull request addresses new features, bug fixing, and maintenance issues submitted by both integrators or contributors. It appears that many empirical studies are conducted to discover how pull request evaluation is done, and to our knowledge, limited research exists for assessing release readiness of pull requests. Studies also reported that the failure rate of pull-requests rapidly increases when there are many forks created. It is therefore, questions worth exploring are whether the code review really contributing to the code quality, and how to determine the release readiness of pull requests? In our previous work, test and defect coverage-based analytics model (TDCAM) has been proven to be suitable to determine the readiness of releases for software that is rapidly evolving, in which this is also a characteristic of pull-based software development. In this paper, the TDCAM has been extended to include pull request coverage indicators.

To tackle both issues, we propose MINJIE, an open-source platform supporting agile processor development flow. MINJIE integrates a broad set of tools for logic design, functional verification, performance modelling, pre-silicon validation and debugging for better development efficiency of state-of-the-art processor designs. We demonstrate the usage and effectiveness of MINJIE by building two generations of an open-source superscalar out-of-order RISC-V processor code-named XIANGSHAN using agile methodologies.

The information that the VIPER rover provides will help improve understanding of the composition, distribution, and accessibility of Lunar polar volatiles and will help determine how the Moon's resources can support future human space exploration. VIPER, however, represents a radical departure from the way that NASA has traditionally developed planetary robotic missions. A key consequence of these differences is that estimating the cost of VIPER's rover software is challenging and complex. For example, VIPER is being developed using management procedures typically applied to NASA research and technology projects, rather than space flight programs. In addition, key portions of the rover's software are being designed as ground software to run on mission control computers (rather than onboard the rover as flight software as with prior planetary missions) taking advantage of continuous, interactive data communications between the Moon and Earth and higher performance computing available on the ground. Moreover, the rover's software is being engineered using Agile software development practices and incorporates a significant amount of open-source code, rather than following traditional (spiral, waterfall, etc.) development methods and in-house code. In this paper, we present an innovative process to estimate the life cycle cost of VIPER's rover software. We first describe how we modeled the architecture and code counts for three software elements: Rover Flight Software (RFSW), Rover Ground Software (RGSW), and Rover Simulation Software (RSIM). We then discuss key challenges and unique aspects of our approach, such as the lack of Lunar rover analogies, the need to integrate and test large open source software, and the strategies developed to account for use of non-space flight management practices and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We conclude with a summary of our results, including cumulative distribution, nearest neighbors and cluster analysis, as well as heuristics used to confirm the reasonableness of the cost estimate.",1,15,7 jun. 2021,7 jun. 2021,2021 IEEE Aerospace Conference (50100)

However, software industries usually apply a lot of convincing strategies to ensure the delivery of bug-free software products. Due to the iterative and incremental nature of Agile projects, testing activities are simultaneously organized by the Scrum Masters along with the routine development exercises. Regression testing is such type of testing technique that is performed to corroborate and ensure the impact of any new code in the existing modules of the software product. Proper optimization practices can reduce the efforts and time required to conduct Regression Testing. Although, it is quite challenging to optimize regression testing activities. So there is a need to implement an automotive regression testing mechanism that is based on associated risks and test prioritization to reduce the testing time and effort of testing engineers. In this research paper, we discussed the challenges and strategies to develop optimized regression testing in Agile methodologies.

Companies such as Microsoft have invested in in-house infrastructures with the goal of optimizing the build process. CloudBuild, a distributed and caching build service developed internally by Microsoft, runs the build process in parallel in the cloud and relies on caching to accelerate builds. This allows for agile development and rapid delivery of software even several times a day. However, moving towards faster builds requires not only improvements on the infrastructure side, but also attention to developers' changes in the software. Surely, architectural decisions and software changes, such as addition of dependencies, can lead to significant build time increase. Yet, estimating the impact of such changes on build time can be challenging when dealing with complex, distributed, and cached build systems. In this paper, we envision a predictive model able to preemptively alert developers on the extent to which their software changes may impact future building activities. In particular, we describe an approach that analyzes the developer's change and predicts (i) whether it impacts (any of) the Longest Critical Path; (ii) may lead to build time increase and its delta; and (iii) the percentage of future builds that might be affected by such change.",8,10,22-Aug-19,22-Aug-19,2019 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME)

However, attaining robust security assurance while delivering features requires a precarious balancing act in the context of agile development practices. One path forward to help aid development teams in securing their software products is through the design and development of security-focused automation. Ergo, we present a novel approach, called SecureReqNet, for automatically identifying whether issues in software issue tracking systems describe security-related content. Our approach consists of a two-phase neural net architecture that operates purely on the natural language descriptions of issues. The first phase of our approach learns high dimensional word embeddings from hundreds of thousands of vulnerability descriptions listed in the CVE database and issue descriptions extracted from open source projects. The second phase then utilizes the semantic ontology represented by these embeddings to train a convolutional neural network capable of predicting whether a given issue is security-related. We evaluated SecureReqNet by applying it to identify security-related issues from a dataset of thousands of issues mined from popular projects on GitLab and GitHub. In addition, we also applied our approach to identify security-related requirements from a commercial software project developed by a major telecommunication company. Our preliminary results are encouraging, with SecureReqNet achieving an accuracy of 96% on open source issues and 71.6% on industrial requirements.",11,24,05-Dec-19,05-Dec-19,2020 IEEE Green Technologies Conference(GreenTech)

One of the main problem with agile methodologies is the quality and the quantity of testing tasks to be performed, which in many cases are focused on unitary testing. This causes different issues for agile projects at the integration of sub-systems or the acceptance of the products developed. Continuous integration (CI) technique is commonly used to avoid some integration problems because it improves the validation of the software products by means of the automatic execution of different test cases at the moment of updating a software product located in a version control platform. Nevertheless, these test cases are manly focused on unitary testing and they are created for specific platforms. This paper presents an open source framework to improve continuous integration in order to execute acceptance test cases automatically. In particular, we use Behavioral Driven Development (BDD) to create the test cases that can be used with web and mobile drivers for different platforms.

In this paper, we detail how the operations team responded to several challenges such as the reduction in personnel after the Launch and Early Orbit Operations phase, the addition of a downlink antenna in Japan, high-fidelity collection requests during the unusually active 2017 Atlantic hurricane season, and the increased demands of team members from other projects. These pressures forced the CYGNSS operations team to innovate their way to efficient operations. These innovations were enabled by embracing modern open-source tools such as Django, Bokeh, Git, the various libraries available in the Python programming language, and the capabilities that come with all of our operations engineers being competent in software development. The CYGNSS team took the approach of automating the most time-intensive tasks first, which freed up time to carefully design and test more elaborate automation solutions. We utilized the spirit of the Agile Methodology to make incremental improvements to our software suite which further enabled more sophisticated automation. Finally, we chart a path forward to fully closing the automation loop between our mission planning, and real-time Command and Control.",,7,20 jun. 2019,20 jun. 2019,2020 International Workshop on Rapid System Prototyping (RSP)

Yet, the state-of-the-art estimation techniques' accuracy has room for improvement. In this paper, we present a new approach for SP estimation, based on analysing textual features of software issues by employing latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and clustering. We first use LDA to represent issue reports in a new space of generated topics. We then use hierarchical clustering to agglomerate issues into clusters based on their topic similarities. Next, we build estimation models using the issues in each cluster. Then, we find the closest cluster to the new coming issue and use the model from that cluster to estimate the SP. Our approach is evaluated on a dataset of 26 open source projects with a total of 31,960 issues and compared against both baselines and state-of-the-art SP estimation techniques. The results show that the estimation performance of our proposed approach is as good as the state-of-the-art. However, none of these approaches is statistically significantly better than more naive estimators in all cases, which does not justify their additional complexity. We therefore encourage future work to develop alternative strategies for story points estimation.

Story-point estimation enables software development teams to, among other things, better scope products, prioritize requirements, allocate resources and measure progress. Several machine learning techniques have been proposed for automated story-point estimation. However, most of these techniques use open-source projects for evaluation. There are important differences between open-source and commercial projects with respect to story authoring. The goal of this paper is to evaluate a state-of-the-art machine learning technique, known as Deep-SE [3], for estimating story points in a commercial project. Our dataset is comprised of 4,727 stories for a data anonymization product developed by a 27-member agile team at a healthcare data science company, IQVIA. Over this dataset, Deep-SE achieved a mean absolute error of 1.46, significantly better than three different baselines. Model performance nonetheless varied across stories, with the estimation error being larger for stories that had higher points. Our results further indicate that model performance is correlated with certain story characteristics such as the level of detail and the frequency of vague terms in the stories. An important take-away from our study is that, before organizations attempt to introduce machine learning-based estimation into agile development, they need to better embrace agile best practices, particularly in relation to story authoring and expert-based estimation.",2,23,27-Oct-21,27-Oct-21,2021 IEEE 29th International Requirements Engineering Conference Workshops (REW)

However, the risk of project failure or time and budget overruns is still a relevant problem. This paper aims to present and discuss a new approach to model some key risk factors in agile development, using software process simulation modeling (SPSM), which can complement other approaches, and whose usage is particularly suited for agile development. We introduce a new approach to modeling some key risk factors – namely project duration, number of implemented issues, and key statistics of issue completion time – using a simulator of agile development, which we developed for this purpose. The approach includes modeling the agile process, gathering data from the tool used for project management, and performing Monte Carlo simulations of the process, to get insights about the expected time and effort to complete the project, and about their distributions. The model’s parameters that can cause risk are errors in effort estimation of the features to develop, variations in developers’ assignment to these features, impediments related to developers’ availability and work completion. To validate the simulator, and to demonstrate how the method can be used, we analyzed three open-source projects, gathering their data from JIRA repositories. We ran Monte Carlo simulations of these projects, showing that the simulator can well approximate the progress of the real project, then varying the identified risk factors and statistically evaluating their effects on the risk parameters. The proposed approach is relevant for project managers, being able to quantitatively evaluate the risks, provided that the process and the project’s data are properly modeled and gathered. As for the future, we are working to improve our risk assessment method, evaluating it on more case studies, scaling the model from a single team to multiple teams involved in one or more projects.",2,54,27-Sep-21,05-Oct-21,IEEE Access

To do this, we study data from seven open-source projects and calculated both the individual velocity of developers and focus factor of teams per iteration. First, we applied statistical process control to identify iterations with out-of-control velocity and focus factor values. Then, we studied these iterations regarding four context factors that partly characterize the dynamics of open-source projects, i.e., iteration length, turnover of developers who left, turnover of new developers, and team stability index.

For software engineering instructors trying to teach such TPs to student teams, manually auditing teams if teams are following the TPs and improving over time is tedious, time-consuming and error-prone. It is even more difficult when those TPs involve two or more tools. For example, starting work on a feature in a project-management tool such as Pivotal Tracker should usually be followed relatively quickly by the creation of a feature branch on GitHub. Merging a feature branch on GitHub should usually be followed relatively quickly by deploying the new feature to a staging server for customer feedback. Few systems are designed specifically to audit such TPs, and existing ones, as far as we know, are limited to a single specific tool. We present Bluejay, an open-source extensible platform that uses the APIs of multiple tools to collect raw data, synthesize it into TP measurements, and present dashboards to audit the TPs. A key insight in Bluejay's design is that TPs can be expressed in terminology similar to that used for modeling and auditing Service Level Agreement (SLA) compliance. Bluejay therefore builds on mature tools used in that ecosystem and adapts them for describing, auditing, and reporting on TPs. Bluejay currently consumes data from five different widely-used development tools, and can be customized by connecting it to any service with a REST API.

The numerous recent Hardware Construction Languages such as Chisel are providing enhanced ways to design complex hardware architectures with notable academic and industrial successes. While the latter environments are now mature and perfectly suited for brand new projects, migrating partially or entirely existing Verilog code-base proves to be a challenging and very time-consuming process. Successful migrations need to be able to leverage finely tuned existing hardware descriptions as a basis to build complex systems through simple iterations. This article introduces sv2chisel, an open-source automated (System)Verilog to Chisel translator as entry point for this iterative migration processes.

Most existing methods rely on fixed-size counters, which may be wasteful in terms of space, as counters must be large enough to eliminate any risk of overflow. Instead, some solutions use small, fixed-size counters that may overflow into secondary structures.This paper takes a different approach. We propose a simple and general method called SALSA for dynamic re-sizing of counters, and show its effectiveness. SALSA starts with small counters, and overflowing counters simply merge with their neighbors. SALSA can thereby allow more counters for a given space, expanding them as necessary to represent large numbers. Our evaluation demonstrates that, at the cost of a small overhead for its merging logic, SALSA significantly improves the accuracy of popular schemes (such as Count-Min Sketch and Count Sketch) over a variety of tasks.

Musicians and music scholars alike normally evaluate such parameters visually by departing from scores, which present the musical events at once. Yet for the under-standing of such symbolic representations, musical training is essential, making scores mostly incomprehensible for amateurs. Data visualisation has been applied to meaningfully represent complex musical parameters, thus enabling music amateurs to grasp concepts such as texture or structure. Although scores are one of the ""primary"" sources to understand music, previous work shows a strong bias towards the visualisation of acoustic data, in detriment of the visualisation of symbolic information. To bridge the gap, we present SymPlot, a web-based open source tool to automatically visualise textural density, scoring, and structure from MusicXML files. Due to the multidisciplinary nature of the topic, in this project we have applied the Scrum's agile methodology, an iterative incremental approach specifically tailored for interdisciplinary projects. The tool, aimed at enhancing musical understanding in amateurs and students, as well as in scholars of other disciplines who need to incorporate music into their discourses, i.e., historians, philologists, etc., enables visualisation of local features at various hierarchical levels, highlighting similarities both within and across scores. Our evaluation of SymPlot-based on a five-level rating-scale test performed by 50 participants-suggests that colours increase users' understanding of complex musical parameters.",,35,11 mar. 2021,11 mar. 2021,2019 IEEE Aerospace Conference
Reusable Learning Objects: An Agile Approach,,R. P.

Reusable Learning Objects have actually been discussed in the literature for the last 20 years and yet true large scale sharing of learning and teaching materials remains relatively rare and challenging. This paper argues that part of the reason is that the granularity of the learning objects that are in use today is not conducive to true reuse. Certainly whole PowerPoint slide decks and word documents are kept in individuals' folders; perhaps bits are cut and pasted and emailed around; but providence, permissions, tracking and tracing are ad-hoc and styling, formatting, templates, slide layouts need to be tended to repeatedly. It is not an ideal situation. As a result, educators, teachers, course designers, are constantly reinventing the wheel, or searching for where that one excellent assignment, explanation, definition was last seen so it can be copied forward.This paper argues that to achieve effective reuse of Learning Objects, the following are required: smaller, more granular (""micro"") learning objects; means to combine them into larger presentation products; and modern revision and version control. The paper proposes applying approaches originating in the software engineering community, such as agile methodology, version control and management, markup languages, and agile publishing, which together form the ""Agile Approach"" of the title of the paper. With that foundation laid, the paper examines ""CourseGen"", an open source software platform designed for creating, sharing, reusing and publishing reusable course content. CourseGen uses a modified markdown format augmented by CourseGen specific directives, such as $link to and $include topic. The CourseGen compiler converts a collection of CourseGen files into the final format such as a web site or a PowerPoint. CourseGen was designed, used and refined over the last three years in several Computer Science Courses at Brandeis University.",3,11,04-Dec-20,04-Dec-20,2019 International Conference on Sensing and Instrumentation in IoT Era (ISSI)

Moodle LMS as open source system was used as alternative to build e-learning software with traffic impact analysis (Andalalin) material as the case study. This study had done comparison design between system development from scratch and system development using existing component to prove that component-based development could be used as alternative for software development. The comparison started from development steps, strength and weakness of each methods, effort, and time. The effort and time estimation calculation were done by using adjusted story points (ASF) methods for Scrum methodology and COCOMO for CBSE methodology. To discover the flexibility of component-based development using Moodle, this study built additional component that related to the case study needs. After that, functional and nonfunctional testing was done towards the whole system which was developed using Moodle. This study also raised component addition model which could be used to integrate web-based additional component. The comparison result which was done in this study showed the development steps with component-based development were simpler than from scratch development. However, the effort estimation result for each methodology could not be compared, with the ASP value to calculate effort estimation was 1.1832 for Scrum methodology and 1.89 ManMonth for CBSE methodology from COCOMO calculation. Meanwhile, the time estimation result did not show the advantages of CBSE methodology because the calculation result was 12 weeks or 3 months for Scrum methodology and 3.18 months for CBSE methodology. The component additional model which was used to integrate web-based additional component into Moodle was successfully implemented. The evaluation result of Andalalin e-learning system showed the needs of Andalalin material learning could be fulfilled. Furthermore, the performance testing, which was done using Moodle Benchmark, found that the environment, where Moodle system was implemented, affected the system performance. From the usability testing and questionnaire result, the Moodle system was considered not difficult for respondents to use.

However, for real-scale MSA, a pure black-box strategy may not be able to exercise the system to properly cover the interactions involving internal microservices.We propose a grey-box strategy (MACROHIVE) for automated testing and monitoring of (internal) microservices interactions. It uses combinatorial testing to generate valid and invalid tests from microservices specification. Tests execution and monitoring are automated by a service mesh infrastructure. MACROHIVE runs the tests and traces the interactions among microservices, to report about internal coverage and failing behaviour.MACROHIVE is experimented on TrainTicket, an open-source MSA benchmark. It performs comparably to state-of-the-art techniques in terms of edge-level coverage, but exposes internal failures undetected by black-box testing, gives detailed internal coverage information, and requires fewer tests.",,56,20 mar. 2023,20 mar. 2023,"2022 IEEE 22nd International Conference on Software Quality, Reliability and Security (QRS)"

When dependent tasks are assigned to different developers, there is need for coordination between developers. The needs of coordination are difficult to quantify, however, quantification of the needs of coordination is an important factor to accurately estimate team performance of a sprint. In this paper, a method is proposed to calculate distribution of task dependency among developers, and the distribution is defined as Coordination Needs. An experiment on an open source project, Spring, demonstrates that the Coordination Needs is strongly correlated with team performance. With the method, the Coordination Needs of task allocation is revealed so team performance of a sprint can be accurately estimated, and task allocation can be optimized.",,14,23-Feb-21,23-Feb-21,2020 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)

In addition to suggesting several personalized activities, presenting an instance of application of a teaching syllabus that adheres to several reference syllabus, this model also seeks to be extensible, to be applied in other teaching areas, trying not to be limited to the software testing area. The construction of this model makes use of practical teaching approaches supported by practices, such as gamification and playful teaching to motivate and engage participants, bringing common tasks and technologies in the software industry in parallel to classic lecture classes, in order to develop certain skills, which were obtained through academic syllabus, together with technical skills in software testing for participants, in addition to knowledge of several open source tools that are used by testing professionals in the software industry. This construction is specified in several stages arranged in a teaching cycle, being sequenced when they are applied and can be adapted for other learning scenarios. Subsequently, the skills, competences and support materials that can be used are presented in addition to the possible effects expected on students from the application of this model in the teaching of software testing. As it uses practical teaching approaches, it is advisable that this model is used by professors who have a teaching facilitator profile, as it presents humanistic teaching learning, with a focus on participants and teamwork, principles found in agile methods, in which activities will have deliveries of products that approach what is performed in a software company and it will be necessary the interaction of all participants in the model. The evaluation process for this teaching model took place in two stages. First, there was an analysis and individual evaluation of the model through the questionnaire, then there was a consensus meeting between the evaluators, where they justified the marks attributed in the evaluation and their considerations on other responses. This meeting aimed to solve disagreements and collect opinions, enabling problems to be solved and reaching a final consensus among the evaluators.
