A class-level test selection approach toward full coverage for continuous integration,"Li Y., Wang J., Wang Q., Hu J.","Proceedings of the International Conference on Software Engineering and Knowledge Engineering, SEKE",2019,49,54,,"Continuous Integration (CI) is an important practice in agile development. With the growth of integration system, running all tests to verify the quality of submitted code, is clearly uneconomical. This paper aims at selecting a proper test subset towards full coverage of all changed and affected code so as to reduce the cost of CI testing. We proposes FEST, a novel approach, which searches for the full dependencies of changed code at the class level and then selects test classes related to the changed and affected classes. We assess FEST from fault detection efficiency and cost effectiveness based on 18 open source projects with 261 continuous integration versions from Eclipse and Apache communities, and compare it with the state-of-the-art approach ClassSRTS (as baseline). Results show that FEST (1) can not only cover all faults detected by actual CI testing and baseline, but also find new faults in 25% and 18% versions respectively. (2) shows better or equal test scale benefits than actual CI testing (in 98% versions) and baseline (in 99% versions); and can compensate risk of omitting necessary tests for actual CI testing (in 62% versions) and baseline (in 73% versions). © 2019 Knowledge Systems Institute Graduate School.

"A generalized, enterprise-level systems development process framework for systems analysis and design education","Topi H., Spurrier G.",Journal of Information Systems Education,2019,253,265,,"Current academic and industry discussions regarding systems development project approaches increasingly focus on agile development and/or DevOps, as these approaches are seen as more modern, streamlined, flexible, and, therefore, effective as compared to traditional plan-driven approaches. This extends to the current pedagogy for teaching systems analysis and design (SA&D). However, overemphasizing agile and DevOps neglects broader dimensions that are essential for planning and executing enterprise-level systems projects. Thus, a dilemma may arise: do we teach agile and DevOps techniques that may be inadequate for enterprise-level projects or do we teach the wider range of plan-driven skills and techniques that may conflict with the tenets and benefits of agile and DevOps? In this paper, we advocate for resolving this dilemma by adopting a generalized process framework that both fully supports enterprise-level projects but can also be selectively scaled back toward increased agility for smaller, less complex projects. In its full realization, this framework combines extensive project planning and up-front requirements with iterative delivery - an increasingly popular approach today for enterprise projects. In scaling back toward agile, the framework carefully accounts for system, environment, and team characteristics. Further, the model emphasizes issues frequently underemphasized by agile approaches, including the use of external software such as commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS), Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), and open source products and components; the need for business-oriented project planning and justification; and support for change management to ensure successful system adoption. The framework thereby flexibly accommodates the full range of activities that software projects must support to be successful. © 2019 by the Information Systems & Computing Academic Professionals, Inc.", , ,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85081170743&partnerID=40&md5=d115bb3e6e7f3c68e1778b37c8a1fe0a, 
A numerical investigation on the thermo-chemical structures of methane-oxygen diffusion flame-streets in a microchannel,"Kang X., Sun B., Wang J., Wang Y.",Combustion and Flame,2019,266,281,,"“Flame-street” refers to the interesting combustion phenomenon that a diffusion flame in a narrow channel is separated into a discrete series of flame segments. Although flame-street has been observed experimentally for more than a decade, numerical simulations of this phenomenon with realistic chemistry and detailed analysis of its thermo-chemical structures have yet to be performed. In this paper, the methane-oxygen diffusion flame-street observed by Misse et al. (2005) [36] in a microchannel was numerically reproduced using a reacting flow solver developed based on the open-source framework OpenFOAM. The main purpose of the present work is to investigate the detailed thermo-chemical structures of diffusion flame-street in the anticipation of a deep understanding of the underlying mechanisms responsible for its formation. Our simulation results show that the presence of discrete flame segments can strongly affect the flow field. In addition, the flame-street was found to consist of a bibrachial leading flame with a long diffusion tail and a much weaker fuel-lean premixed branch, and consecutive downstream “new moon”-like flamelets each with a fuel-lean and a fuel-rich premixed branch. Chemical structures of these flame branches were analyzed by examining critical reactions that contribute significantly to the overall heat release. Finally, the effects of channel wall thermal conditions and species mass diffusion on the formation of the flame-street were investigated. It was found that the flame street could be established only at a moderate level of heat loss to the wall: significantly enhanced or reduced heat losses would result in either a single short edge flame or a long continuous edge flame. Increased mass diffusivity was seen to enhance combustion, elongate the leading flame, and even lead to more flame segments that appeared within the channel, although they may exist in a unsteady mode, being repetitively split, moving downstream and being blown-out/extinguished. © 2019 The Combustion Institute", , ,10.1016/j.combustflame.2019.05.006,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85065602980&doi=10.1016%2fj.combustflame.2019.05.006&partnerID=40&md5=6d725293e4b8109f81b7702a81a6a3c4, 
Agile challenges and chances for open source: Lessons learned from managing a floss project,Muller M.,"2018 IEEE Conference on Open Systems, ICOS 2018",2019,1,6,,"Open source projects got an important part today's software landscape. Thousands of these projects are collaboratively driven by communities following a shared vision. But governing open communities towards this shared vision comes along with various difficulties. In general, agile methods allow to manage such systems of collaborative development and constant change. But as this work shows, the agile approach not only provides chances in open settings. A variety of challenges occur that need to be considered. The case of Catrobat, a Free/Libre Open Source project, shows that although open source development and agile methods evolved over the last years, the dynamics of open communities still challenge the agile way. However, evaluating and understanding these dynamics, as well as introducing agile elements, such as the role of product owners, can be beneficial for managing open systems and to drive it into a common direction together with the contributors. © 2018 IEEE.", , ,10.1109/ICOS.2018.8632819,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85062868063&doi=10.1109%2fICOS.2018.8632819&partnerID=40&md5=6c5b9f3432d740e4635ba5bec309713f, 
"An Open Source, Iterative Dual-Tree Wavelet Background Subtraction Method Extended from Automated Diffraction Pattern Analysis to Optical Spectroscopy","Chevalier R.B., Dwyer J.R.",Applied Spectroscopy,2019,1370,1379,,"Background subtraction is a general problem in spectroscopy often addressed with application-specific techniques, or methods that introduce a variety of implementation barriers such as having to specify peak-free regions of the spectrum. An iterative dual-tree complex wavelet transform-based background subtraction method (DTCWT-IA) was recently developed for the analysis of ultrafast electron diffraction patterns. The method was designed to require minimal user intervention, to support streamlined analysis of many diffraction patterns with complex overlapping peaks and time-varying backgrounds, and is implemented in an open-source computer program. We examined the performance of DTCWT-IA for the analysis of spectra acquired by a range of optical spectroscopies including ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy (UV–Vis), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). A key benefit of the method is that the user need not specify regions of the spectrum where no peaks are expected to occur. SER spectra were used to investigate the robustness of DTCWT-IA to signal-to-noise levels in the spectrum and to user operation, specifically to two of the algorithm parameter settings: decomposition level and iteration number. The single, general DTCWT-IA implementation performs well in comparison to the different conventional approaches to background subtraction for UV–Vis, XPS, and SERS, while requiring minimal input. The method thus holds the same potential for optical spectroscopy as for ultrafast electron diffraction, namely streamlined analysis of spectra with complex distributions of peaks and varying signal levels, thus supporting real-time spectral analysis or the analysis of data acquired from different sources. © The Author(s) 2019.", , ,10.1177/0003702819871330,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075545023&doi=10.1177%2f0003702819871330&partnerID=40&md5=8039be81ee86b7c28fb4acaefb906cde,

Fluid structure interactions modelling in vented lean deflagrations,"Vendra C.M.R., Wen J.X.",Journal of Loss Prevention in the Process Industries,2019,183,194,,"The standard 20 ft ISO containers are studied both experimentally and numerically with model obstacles to ascertain the peak overpressures generated in case of an accidental fast deflagrations. Apart from overpressure its often important to know the maximum deflections of the enclosures to examine the structural integrity. The container walls are not rigid; they not only contribute through acoustic response to the pressure waves but also through structural resonance response to the generated overpressures, to capture these effects its necessary to do the Fluid Structure Interaction (FSI) or in simple terms the coupled Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Finite element analysis (FE) simulations. Alternatively, the structural response can be coupled to CFD simulation in either one-way or two-way interactions to reduce the associated computation efforts. Numerical simulations have been conducted with a pseudo two-way coupled CFD & FSI, to aid our understanding of the combination of various factor contributing for the generation of overpressures using an in-house solver developed based on open source CFD code OpenFOAM named as HyFOAM. The CFD solver solves the compressible Navier-stokes equations along with the spring-mass-damper system's single degree of freedom motion equation for coupled fluid structure interactions. The turbulent flame deflagrations are modelled using the flame area combustion model, the necessary modification are incorporated to governing equations to include the dominant flame instabilities present during the vented deflagration process. For lean hydrogen mixtures the Lewis number effects are important hence suitable modelling improvements are added to the combustion model.

Ergo, we present a novel approach, called SecureReqNet, for automatically identifying whether issues in software issue tracking systems describe security-related content. Our approach consists of a two-phase neural net architecture that operates purely on the natural language descriptions of issues. The first phase of our approach learns high dimensional word embeddings from hundreds of thousands of vulnerability descriptions listed in the CVE database and issue descriptions extracted from open source projects. The second phase then utilizes the semantic ontology represented by these embeddings to train a convolutional neural network capable of predicting whether a given issue is security-related. We evaluated SecureReqNet by applying it to identify security-related issues from a dataset of thousands of issues mined from popular projects on GitLab and GitHub. In addition, we also applied our approach to identify security-related requirements from a commercial software project developed by a major telecommunication company.

This paper attempts to study the number of defects in software and the effort required in correcting these defects, simultaneously using desirability function and Taguchi method. Effort is defined as the time span from when the defect was logged into the system to the time when the defect was corrected and removed from the system and is measured in hours.

Open Source Firmware Customization Problem: Experimentation and Challenges,"Ndie T.D., Jonas K.",Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,2019,306,317,,"The great advantages of open source code-based projects like the case of open source firmware (OSF) are flexibility and freedom of customization. However, the difficulty inherent to their development process, which can be seen as a software composition issue, is the lack of structured approach and a teachable methodology for efficiently tackling such project. In this paper, we propose a 5-step pedagogical OSF’s customization approach, coupled with an agile development process to guide the learner and ease his comprehension. We experience this approach to prototype WiAFirm, an OpenWRT-based firmware for operating IEEE 802.11x enabled WAP. Two groups of 04 students each were involved. After 2 months of experimentation, the group that applied the approach was able to integrate into the core OpenWRT a custom WifiDog captive portal feature as a built-in package; while the other group had barely understood the goal of customizing an OSF. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.", , ,10.1007/978-3-030-22868-2_23,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85069508032&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-22868-2_23&partnerID=40&md5=242b34da6823ed80eef86dfc906695cd, 
Open source infrastructure for health care data integration and machine learning analyses,"Isoviita V.-M., Salminen L., Azar J., Lehtonen R., Roering P., Carpen O., Hietanen S., Grenman S., Hynninen J., Farkkila A., Hautaniemi S.",JCO Clinical Cancer Informatics,2019,,,,"PURPOSE We have created a cloud-based machine learning system (CLOBNET) that is an open-source, lean infrastructure for electronic health record (EHR) data integration and is capable of extract, transform, and load (ETL) processing. CLOBNET enables comprehensive analysis and visualization of structured EHR data. We demonstrate the utility of CLOBNET by predicting primary therapy outcomes of patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) on the basis of EHR data. MATERIALS AND METHODS CLOBNET is built using open-source software to make data preprocessing, analysis, and model training user friendly. The source code of CLOBNET is available in GitHub. The HGSOC data set was based on a prospective cohort of 208 patients with HGSOC who were treated at Turku University Hospital, Finland, from 2009 to 2019 for whom comprehensive clinical and EHR data were available. RESULTS We trained machine learning (ML) models using clinical data, including a herein developed dissemination score that quantifies the disease burden at the time of diagnosis, to identify patients with progressive disease (PD) or a complete response (CR) on the basis of RECIST (version 1.1). The best performance was achieved with a logistic regression model, which resulted in an area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.86, with a specificity of 73% and a sensitivity of 89%, when it classified between patients who experienced PD and CR. CONCLUSION We have developed an open-source computational infrastructure, CLOBNET, that enables effective and rapid analysis of EHR and other clinical data. Our results demonstrate that CLOBNET allows predictions to be made on the basis of EHR data to address clinically relevant questions. © 2019 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.", , ,10.1200/CCI.18.00132,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076103257&doi=10.1200%2fCCI.18.00132&partnerID=40&md5=feea507ffa1abeed58827f33caf18aba,

How do RISC-V, Rocket Chip and Chisel enable open-source chip agile development? With some case studies during the development of the Labeled RISC-V project led by the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, this article shows: 1) An open and active ISA ecosystem (such as RISC-V) is a necessary condition to promote chip innovation; 2) Chisel's features such as bulk connection, metaprogramming, object-oriented programming, and functional programming, can greatly reduce the amount of code and improve code maintainability; 3) Agile development can achieve an order of magnitude improvement in coding efficiency, while achieving comparable or even better performance, power consumption and area overhead than traditional hardware development models. © 2019, Science Press.

Real-time drilling advisor appstore – An agile development and deployment program,"Liu Y., Wu X., Baumgartner T., Zimpfer D., Wedgwood D., Teff C., Zhu J., Jia Y., Zhao Y., Tao L.","SPE/IADC Drilling Conference, Proceedings",2019,,,,"In the new wave of digitization, real-time advisory mode drilling data analytics is both an intermediate step to achieve long term vision of autonomous drilling and an agile response to the need of delivering beyond best in class wells. An operator has constructed an agile program for drilling data analytics to lead the development of analytics solutions, deployment to collect business values, and handover to productization. The product under development is a Real-Time Drilling Advisor (RTDA) Appstore, which is both an R&D template for prototyping and a hosting environment for rapid field trials and early deployments. The RTDA Appstore consists of a witsml data pipeline, template of drilling data analytics functionalities, modularized computational kernels, machine learning packages for historical data analysis, an in-memory database for both historical and real-time processed data, customized drilling visualization widgets, and an open-source web app deployment framework. A hybrid methodology combining conventional engineering practice, data-driven approaches, novel visualization formats, and physics-based modeling is adopted to develop real-time data analytics solutions. It focuses on three areas: failure detection, performance improvement, and advisory directional drilling. A list of applications and features in the RTDA Appstore includes: interactive offset data map, drilling parameter roadmap, drilling efficiency monitoring, bit/reamer wear prediction, smart torque/drag, payzone tracking, auto slide sheets, sliding KPI, real-time casing wear, real-time BIC benchmarking, etc. So far, about 30 wells of the company's Deepwater wells and about 150 of the company's unconventional wells were drilled using RTDA applications. RTDA deployments generated time and cost savings through early warnings or bespoke visualization of information for improved decision making. The RTDA Appstore is built in-house and thus provides flexibility and modularization options and heavily focused on the analytics layer. The agile program creates an interactive channel to not only meet business demand, but also to use feedback from operations to steer the digital R&D strategy. As the half open-source nature of this program, the digital capability cultivated through the development and deployment of RTDA will also be cascaded to local wells teams through format of digital training, code repository, and a single portal Appstore.

Although there are several approaches that mine contributions' data, they usually view contributors as a uniform body of engineers, and focus mainly on the aspect of productivity while neglecting the quality of the work performed. In this work, we design a methodology for identifying engineer roles in development teams and determine the behaviors that prevail for each role. Using a dataset of GitHub projects, we perform clustering against the DevOps axis, thus identifying three roles: developers that are mainly preoccupied with code commits, operations engineers that focus on task assignment and acceptance testing, and the lately popular role of DevOps engineers that are a mix of both. Our analysis further extracts behavioral patterns for each role, this way assisting team leaders in knowing their team and effectively directing responsibilities to achieve optimal workload balancing and task allocation.

Companies such as Microsoft have invested in in-house infrastructures with the goal of optimizing the build process. CloudBuild, a distributed and caching build service developed internally by Microsoft, runs the build process in parallel in the cloud and relies on caching to accelerate builds. This allows for agile development and rapid delivery of software even several times a day. However, moving towards faster builds requires not only improvements on the infrastructure side, but also attention to developers' changes in the software. Surely, architectural decisions and software changes, such as addition of dependencies, can lead to significant build time increase. Yet, estimating the impact of such changes on build time can be challenging when dealing with complex, distributed, and cached build systems. In this paper, we envision a predictive model able to preemptively alert developers on the extent to which their software changes may impact future building activities. In particular, we describe an approach that analyzes the developer's change and predicts (i) whether it impacts (any of) the Longest Critical Path; (ii) may lead to build time increase and its delta; and (iii) the percentage of future builds that might be affected by such change. © 2019 IEEE.", , ,10.1109/ICSE-NIER.2019.00021,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85072060436&doi=10.1109%2fICSE-NIER.2019.00021&partnerID=40&md5=3c6ef7f3312d48e581c232892f2ee69a, 
TWINS - This workflow is not scrum: Agile process adaptation for open source software projects,"Robinson P., Beecham S.","Proceedings - 2019 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software and System Processes, ICSSP 2019",2019,24,33,,"It is becoming commonplace for companies to contribute to open source software (OSS) projects. At the same time, many software organizations are applying Scrum software development practices, for productivity and quality gains. Scrum calls for self-organizing teams, in which the development team has total control over its development process. However, OSS projects typically have their own processes and standards, which might not mesh well with a company's internal processes, such as Scrum. This paper presents an experience report from Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE), where the 'toolchain CPU compiler' team directly participates in the 'LLVM' OSS project. The team ran into a number of difficulties when using Scrum to manage their development. In particular, the team often failed to complete Scrum sprints where tasks required interaction with the open source community. We look at how the team redefined task flows to alleviate these difficulties, and eventually evolved a highly modified process, dubbed TWINS (This Workflow Is Not Scrum). We assess the revised process, and compare it to other established agile methods, finding it bears a strong resemblance to Scrumban (the SIE team was not aware of Scrumban previously). The TWINS framework presented here may help other organizations who develop software in-house and engage in OSS projects, to gain the best of both worlds. © 2019 IEEE.", , ,10.1109/ICSSP.2019.00014,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85072342893&doi=10.1109%2fICSSP.2019.00014&partnerID=40&md5=b5769cd86ef5ebd037f90a3f1def8337, 
When You Have More Satellites than People: The Evolution of CYGNSS Flight Operations,"Medina R., Redfern J., Wells W., Birath E., Lamb D., Alexander A., Ewing T.",IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings,2019,,,,"The flight operations of the Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS), a constellation of eight microsatellites built and operated by Southwest Research Institute (SwRI), designed to improve the intensity forecasts of Tropical Cyclones, has seen a litany of changes to its concept of operations, software, processes, and personnel. In this paper, we detail how the operations team responded to several challenges such as the reduction in personnel after the Launch and Early Orbit Operations phase, the addition of a downlink antenna in Japan, high-fidelity collection requests during the unusually active 2017 Atlantic hurricane season, and the increased demands of team members from other projects. These pressures forced the CYGNSS operations team to innovate their way to efficient operations. These innovations were enabled by embracing modern open-source tools such as Django, Bokeh, Git, the various libraries available in the Python programming language, and the capabilities that come with all of our operations engineers being competent in software development. The CYGNSS team took the approach of automating the most time-intensive tasks first, which freed up time to carefully design and test more elaborate automation solutions. We utilized the spirit of the Agile Methodology to make incremental improvements to our software suite which further enabled more sophisticated automation. Finally, we chart a path forward to fully closing the automation loop between our mission planning, and real-time Command and Control. © 2019 IEEE.", , ,10.1109/AERO.2019.8741926,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85068311329&doi=10.1109%2fAERO.2019.8741926&partnerID=40&md5=e676ed7d795228187641cfcf3b3022e7, 
A new open-source GPU-based microscopic Monte Carlo simulation tool for the calculations of DNA damages caused by ionizing radiation --- Part I: Core algorithm and validation,"Tsai M.-Y., Tian Z., Qin N., Yan C., Lai Y., Hung S.-H., Chi Y., Jia X.",Medical Physics,2020,1958,1970,,"Purpose: Monte Carlo (MC) simulation of radiation interactions with water medium at physical, physicochemical, and chemical stages, as well as the computation of biologically relevant quantities such as DNA damages, are of critical importance for the understanding of microscopic basis of radiation effects. Due to the large problem size and many-body simulation problem in the chemical stage, existing CPU-based computational packages encounter the problem of low computational efficiency. This paper reports our development on a GPU-based microscopic Monte Carlo simulation tool gMicroMC using advanced GPU-acceleration techniques. Methods: gMicroMC simulated electron transport in the physical stage using an interaction-by-interaction scheme to calculate the initial events generating radicals in water. After the physicochemical stage, initial positions of all radicals were determined. Simulation of radicals’ diffusion and reactions in the chemical stage was achieved using a step-by-step model using GPU-accelerated parallelization together with a GPU-enabled box-sorting algorithm to reduce the computations of searching for interaction pairs and therefore improve efficiency. A multi-scale DNA model of the whole lymphocyte cell nucleus containing ~6.2 Gbp of DNA was built. Results: Accuracy of physical stage simulation was demonstrated by computing stopping power and track length. The results agreed with published data and the data produced by GEANT4-DNA (version 10.3.3) simulations with 10 -20% difference in most cases. Difference of yield values of major radiolytic species from GEANT4-DNA results was within 10%. We computed DNA damages caused by monoenergetic 662 keV photons, approximately representing 137Cs decay. Single-strand break (SSB) and double-strand break (DSB) yields were 196 ± 8 SSB/Gy/Gbp and 7.3 ± 0.7 DSB/Gy/Gbp, respectively, which agreed with the result of 188 SSB/Gy/Gbp and 8.4 DSB/Gy/Gbp computed by Hsiao et al. Compared to computation using a single CPU, gMicroMC achieved a speedup factor of ~540x using an NVidia TITAN Xp GPU card. Conclusions: The achieved accuracy and efficiency demonstrated that gMicroMC can facilitate research on microscopic radiation transport simulation and DNA damage calculation. gMicroMC is an open-source package available to the research community. © 2020 American Association of Physicists in Medicine", , ,10.1002/mp.14037,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85079447718&doi=10.1002%2fmp.14037&partnerID=40&md5=a5a2df81722ca67d8a0852fb6fb13f56, 
Acceleration of 4ir driven digital transformation through open source: Methods and parallel industries knowledge reapplication in the field,"Haroon S.S., Viswanathan A., Alyamkin S., Shenoy R.",Proceedings of the Annual Offshore Technology Conference,2020,,,,"In the age of open source, oil and gas companies that invest in licensing proprietary platforms to build artificial intelligence (AI) solutions will have to closely guard against obsolescence. While the mathematics behind AI has existed for decades, its rapid adoption in virtually all sectors has been powered by open source, where a global community of academicians and data scientists are continuously developing and improving the mathematics behind the predictive and prescriptive solutions of the future. We posit that the existence of AI software development, which we describe as data driven analytical solutions providing predictive and prescriptive answers to questions, is solely due to the academia's focus on research and its pedagogical goals driving the dissemination of the research to the open source community to move the research to development. Indeed, all data science coursework is steeped in training on open source platforms and tools. When models do not depend on platforms, organizations can deploy flexible and agile software that has the ability to leverage better methods that come out in the future. Borrowing ideas from other industries we can see that just as Wordpress and its open source community of designers and developers revolutionized how websites are created, software that can quickly deploy the best available technology (and be mobile) while maintaining the security of the data is poised for user adoption and success where legacy systems and traditional dashboards fail. While the mathematics of physics does not change our confidence in its accuracy, in comparison, the mathematics of an AI algorithm is an approximation. This mathematics is being continuously improved though rarely achieving 100% accuracy. Algorithms are built upon open source AI libraries that are continuously improving. Similarly, the methods and techniques for developing the AI algorithms in oil and gas are continuously improving through two main sources, academia and adjacent industries reapplication of AI methods. We provide examples of open source technologies already part and parcel of all data scientists' repertoire of development, who are currently working in oil and gas. We further showcase reapplication of solutions from other industries, such as, medical image data analysis to seismic data processing and subsurface characterization. © 2020, Offshore Technology Conference.", , ,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85086245295&partnerID=40&md5=11cbbbc1c1a9e81bd13b1dd22a0d7e99, 
An extensive study of class-level and method-level test case selection for continuous integration,"Li Y., Wang J., Yang Y., Wang Q.",Journal of Systems and Software,2020,,,,"Continuous Integration (CI) is an important practice in agile development. With the growth of integration system, running all tests to verify the quality of submitted code, is clearly uneconomical. This paper aims at selecting a proper test subset for continuous integration so as to reduce test cost as much as possible without sacrificing quality. We first propose a static test case selection framework Sapient which aims at selecting a precise test subset towards fully covering all changed code and affected code. There are four major steps: locate changes, build dependency graphs, identify related tests by searching dependency graphs, and extend tests. Based on Sapient, we then develop a class-level test case selection approach FEST and a method-level approach MEST. FEST captures the class-level dependencies, especially the hidden references, which facilitates the modeling of full dependency relations at the class level. MEST combines two dynamic execution rules (i.e., dynamic invocation in reflection and dynamic binding in inheritance) with static dependencies to support building the precise method-level dependencies. Evaluation is conducted on 18 open source projects with 261 continuous integration versions from Eclipse and Apache communities. Results show that both FEST and MEST can detect almost all faults of two baselines (i.e., actual CI testing and ClassSRTS), and find new faults compared with actual CI testing (in 25% and 26% versions) and ClassSRTS (in 18% and 27% versions) respectively. Furthermore, MEST outperforms FEST in reduced test size, fault detection efficiency and test cost, indicating method-level test case selection can be more effective than class-level selection. This study can further speed up the feedback and improve the fault detection efficiency of CI testing, and has good application prospects for the CI testing in large-scale and complex systems. © 2020", , ,10.1016/j.jss.2020.110614,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085140525&doi=10.1016%2fj.jss.2020.110614&partnerID=40&md5=6c1de8f9869b9bf3b2c5af7ca6c37a7e,

Learning Agile Scrum Methodology Using the Groupware Tool Trello $$^{\textregistered }$$ Through Collaborative Working,"Naik N., Jenkins P., Newell D.",Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,2020,343,355,,"Agile is a project management philosophy for collaborative working which consists of a set of values and principles that can be employed in any sector. It is adopted by the software development community a long time ago and now several methodologies based on agile principles have become established as a method of software development.

One such agile based methodology is Scrum which is widely used in the software industry and thus in teaching. Several agile Scrum tools are available for software development, however, for teaching and learning purposes, this would not be affordable for many institutions due to its cost or learning curve. This necessitates the requirement for a free or open-source Scrum tool without any learning curve.

Maintainability of Automatic Acceptance Tests for Web Applications—A Case Study Comparing Two Approaches to Organizing Code of Test Cases,"Sadaj A., Ochodek M., Kopczyńska S., Nawrocki J.",Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),2020,454,466,,"[Context] Agile software development calls for test automation since it is critical for continuous development and delivery. However, automation is a challenging task especially for tests of user interface, which can be very expensive. [Problem] There are two extreme approaches of structuring the code of test duties for web-applicating, i.e., linear scripting and keyword-driven scripting technique employing the page object pattern. The goal of this research is to compare them focusing on the maintainability aspect. [Method] We develop and maintain two automatic test suites implementing the same test cases for a mature open-source system using these two approaches. For each approach, we measure the size of the testing codebase and the number of lines of code that need to be modified to keep the test suites passing and valid through five releases of the system. [Results] We observed that the total number of physical lines was higher for the keyword-driven approach than for the linear scripting one. However, the number of programmatical lines of code was smaller for the former. The number of lines of code that had to be modified to maintain the tests was lower for the keyword-driven scripting test suite than for the linear-scripting one. We found the linear-scripting technique was more difficult to maintain because the scripts consist only of low-level code directly interacting with a web browser making it hard to understand the purpose and broader context of the interaction they implement. [Conclusions] We conclude that test suites created using the keyword-driven approach are easier to maintain and more suitable for most of the projects.

On the liquid condensate vertical migration near the production wells of gas-condensate reservoirs,"Salmani N., Fatehi R., Azin R.","Engineering Science and Technology, an International Journal",2020,,,,"Accumulation of liquids in gas-condensate reservoirs may lead to a vertical flow of liquid caused by density difference in the presence of gravity. In this paper, the effect of this vertical flow on the prediction of production data has been investigated. To achieve this goal, a single-layer synthetic cylindrical reservoir is considered and, the flows are simulated with and without vertical direction grid blocks with two lean and rich fluids. The governing equations of the so-called Modified Black-Oil (MBO) model are solved in a cylinder sector using the open-source Matlab Reservoir Simulation Toolbox (MRST). When the vertical flow is taken into consideration, the results show that gravity may lead to migration of liquid condensates to lower regions and the production rates decrease as a consequence of wellbore partially blockage especially for the rich fluid. In addition, gravity may cause a non-linear effect on the flow behavior and increase in the condensates production rates. All results are also obtained for three values of critical liquid condensate saturation to show the effect of this parameter on the production. It has been shown that neglecting the vertical flow may cause significant errors in the result of production, i.e. up to 25% when the fluid is rich and the critical condensate saturation is 0.15. To generalize the effect of the reservoir thickness, dimensional analysis is carried out which yields a similarity parameter. The findings of this study can help for a better understanding of near well flow in gas-condensate reservoirs. Based on this study, in applications in which the reservoir gas is rich in condensate and the thickness of the reservoir layer or the vertical permeability is high enough, it is recommended that the gravity effect is taken into account by enough grid points in the vertical direction in each layer. © 2020 Karabuk University", , ,10.1016/j.jestch.2020.03.006,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85083017533&doi=10.1016%2fj.jestch.2020.03.006&partnerID=40&md5=55b9c20dc3a6f218a8633cb84e0c4c69,

Scalable system and silicon architectures to Handle the workloads of the Post-Moore era,Bolsens I.,Proceedings of the International Symposium on Physical Design,2020,1,2,,"The end of Moore's law has been proclaimed on many occasions and it's probably safe to say that we are now working in the post-Moore era. But no one is ready to slow down just yet. We can view Gordon Moore's observation on transistor densification as just one aspect of a longer-term underlying technological trend - the Law of Accelerating Returns articulated by Kurzweil. Arguably, companies became somewhat complacent in the Moore era, happy to settle for the gains brought by each new process node. Although we can expect scaling to continue, albeit at a slower pace, the end of Moore's Law delivers a stronger incentive to push other trends of technology progress harder. Some exciting new technologies are now emerging such as multichip 3D integration and the introduction of new technologies such as storage-class memory and silicon photonics. Moreover, we are also entering a golden age of computer architecture innovation. One of the key drivers is the pursuit of domain-specific architectures as proclaimed by Turing award winners John Hennessy and David Patterson. A good example is the Xilinx's AI Engine, one of the important features of the Versal™ ACAP (adaptive compute acceleration platform) [1]. Today, the explosion of AI workloads is one of the most powerful drivers shifting our attention to find faster ways of moving data into, across, and out of accelerators. Features such as massive parallel processing elements, the use of domain specific accelerators, the dense interconnect between distributed on-chip memories and processing elements, are examples of the ways chip makers are looking beyond scaling to achieve next-generation performance gains. Next, the growing demands of scaling-out hyperscale datacenter applications drive much of the new architecture developments. Given a high diversification of workloads that invoke massive compute and data movement, datacenter architectures are moving away from rigid CPU-centric structures and instead prioritize adaptability and configurability to optimize resources such as memory and connectivity of accelerators assigned to individual workloads. There is no longer a single figure of merit. It's not all about Tera-OPS. Other metrics such as transfers-per-second and latency come to the fore as demands become more real-time; autonomous vehicles being an obvious and important example. Moreover, the transition to 5G will result in solutions that operate across the traditional boundaries between the cloud and edge and embedded platforms that are obviously power-conscious and cost-sensitive. Future workloads will require agile software flows that accommodate the spread of functions across edge and cloud. Another industry megatrend that will drive technology requirements especially in encryption, data storage and communication, is Blockchain. To some, it may already have a bad reputation, tarnished by association with the anarchy of cryptocurrency, but it will be more widely relevant than many of us realize. Who could have foreseen the development of today's Internet when ARPANET first appeared as a simple platform for distributed computing and sending email? Through projects such as the open-source Hyperledger, Blockchain technology could be game-changing as a platform for building trust in transactions executed over the Internet. We may soon be talking in terms of the Trusted Internet. The predictability of Moore's law may have become rather too comfortable and slow. The future requires maximizing the flexibility, agility, and efficiency of new technologies. With Moore's Law now mostly behind us, new adaptable and scalable architectures will allow us to further provide exponential return from technology in order to create a more adaptable and intelligent world. © 2020 Copyright held by the owner/author.", , ,10.1145/3372780.3378166,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85082554119&doi=10.1145%2f3372780.3378166&partnerID=40&md5=7f679adc93e1fc4c00a3bce19676f430, 
"TimeScale Analysis, Numerical Simulation and Validation of Flame Acceleration, and DDT in Hydrogen–Air Mixtures","Karanam A., Ganju S., Chattopadhyay J.",Combustion Science and Technology,2020,,,,"Flame Acceleration (FA) and Deflagration to Detonation Transition (DDT) are known risks in scenarios involving accidental release and combustion of hydrogen in nuclear reactors. In the present work, chemical timescale and Borghi diagram analysis of hydrogen combustion have been presented. Based on these, a map of the flame propagation in the GraVent shock tube channel has been constructed; and it has been established that the propagation corresponds to the flamelet regime. Subsequently, CFD framework applicable to the flamelet regime such as the geometric approach with turbulent flame closure has been utilized to study deflagrations, FA and DDT. Such methods allow for the computation of pressure transients and flame propagation characteristics with a relatively coarse grid, thereby enabling a balance between computational time and accuracy. Moreover, specific sub-models based on Lewis number and tuned to lean combustion at high pressures have been implemented to further improve the accuracy of the numerical results. All numerical work has been carried out using the open-source numerical platform OpenFOAM. Several numerical simulations with uniform and transversely stratified initial distribution have been carried out and validated with experimental data. In the stratified case, an asymmetric flame front has been observed and is identified to be a key parameter leading to strong FA. Detailed analysis shows that several pressure pulses and shock complexes are formed upstream of the flame. The ensuing shock–flame interaction augments the flame speed ultimately resulting in DDT. Comparative simulations with uniform distribution also show strong FA but DDT does not take place. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.", , ,10.1080/00102202.2020.1732363,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85081284904&doi=10.1080%2f00102202.2020.1732363&partnerID=40&md5=ec1e5cb94f568ec2432edababa6c217b,

Using SIMD and SIMT vectorization to evaluate sparse chemical kinetic Jacobian matrices and thermochemical source terms,"Curtis N.J., Niemeyer K.E., Sung C.-J.",Combustion and Flame,2018,186,204,,"Accurately predicting key combustion phenomena in reactive-flow simulations, e.g., lean blow-out, extinction/ignition limits and pollutant formation, necessitates the use of detailed chemical kinetics. The large size and high levels of numerical stiffness typically present in chemical kinetic models relevant to transportation/power-generation applications make the efficient evaluation/factorization of the chemical kinetic Jacobian and thermochemical source-terms critical to the performance of reactive-flow codes. Here we investigate the performance of vectorized evaluation of constant-pressure/volume thermochemical source-term and sparse/dense chemical kinetic Jacobians using single-instruction, multiple-data (SIMD) and single-instruction, multiple thread (SIMT) paradigms. These are implemented in pyJac, an open-source, reproducible code generation platform. Selected chemical kinetic models covering the range of sizes typically used in reactive-flow simulations were used for demonstration. A new formulation of the chemical kinetic governing equations was derived and verified, resulting in Jacobian sparsities of 28.6–92.0% for the tested models. Speedups of 3.40–4.08 × were found for shallow-vectorized OpenCL source-rate evaluation compared with a parallel OpenMP code on an avx2 central processing unit (CPU), increasing to 6.63–9.44 × and 3.03–4.23 × for sparse and dense chemical kinetic Jacobian evaluation, respectively. Furthermore, the effect of data-ordering was investigated and a storage pattern specifically formulated for vectorized evaluation was proposed; as well, the effect of the constant pressure/volume assumptions and varying vector widths were studied on source-term evaluation performance. Speedups reached up to 17.60 × and 45.13 × for dense and sparse evaluation on the GPU, and up to 55.11 × and 245.63 × on the CPU over a first-order finite-difference Jacobian approach. Further, dense Jacobian evaluation was up to 19.56 × and 2.84 × times faster than a previous version of pyJac on a CPU and GPU, respectively. Finally, future directions for vectorized chemical kinetic evaluation and sparse linear-algebra techniques were discussed. © 2018 The Combustion Institute", , ,10.1016/j.combustflame.2018.09.008,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85053873763&doi=10.1016%2fj.combustflame.2018.09.008&partnerID=40&md5=52a12ad36345ffa6c8b4af82d5bfcf6d, 
SFRAT - An Extendable Software Reliability Assessment Tool,"Nikora A., Fiondella L., Wandji T.","Proceedings - 29th IEEE International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering Workshops, ISSREW 2018",2018,65,70,,"Since its release in the mid-1990s, the Microsoft Windows-based software reliability modeling tool CASRE has been downloaded over 3000 times from the Open Channel Foundation's website. It was also included on the CDROM distributed with the Handbook of Software Reliability Engineering (M. Lyu, ed). In the years since it was first released, however, CASRE has become more difficult to use. This is mainly because there have been no updates since 2000. The last version of Windows on which CASRE would reliably execute was Windows XP, and since it was developed explicitly for Windows, it is not feasible to run it on other platforms. Software development and acquisition organizations continued to be interested in using tools of the same type as CASRE. In 2013, the U.S. Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) contacted the authors at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the University of Massachusetts to determine whether a) CASRE could be modified to run in contemporary environments, or b) whether a new tool with the same functionality as CASRE could be developed with modern programming languages and techniques. After weighing the alternatives, a decision was made to develop a new tool rather than updating CASRE. There were several reasons for which this decision was made. First of all, CASRE had been developed with the programming languages available at the time, in this case C and Fortran. Developing a new tool would allow use of modern, expressive languages and development environments that were particularly well suited to the statistical modeling domain (e.g., R, RStudio). Developing a new tool would also allow us to implement it so that it would run in modern operating environments, specifically Windows, Mac OS, Unix, and Linux. This last design decision would make it possible for users who would not have been able to run CASRE to use the new tool. We wanted to address the difficulty of adding new models to CASRE, since it was not architected for ease of modification. We wanted to develop a tool for which it would be easy to add new models and model evaluation techniques (e.g., prequential likelihood ratio, Akaike Information Criterion). This would enable organizations already using software reliability modeling to manage their testing to place the models they were using into a common framework, making it easier to evaluate multiple sets of results to gain additional insight into their testing process. Researchers would also gain an advantage by having a common framework in which to work with multiple models, analyze their results, and identify relationships among them. Finally, this would make it practical to distribute as open-source software, to which contributors could add new models and evaluation techniques as they were developed by the research community and validated by practitioners. We have used these ideas to develop the Software Failure and Reliability Assessment Tool (SFRAT). It is implemented in R, uses the Shiny user interface package, and will run in any environment in which R and RStudio can run. We intend for it to be an open-source tool with a mechanism for contributors to add new capabilities. Our hope is that distributing SFRAT as open-source software will allow it to retain currency in the software reliability practice and research communities. © 2018 IEEE.", , ,10.1109/ISSREW.2018.00-29,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85059844323&doi=10.1109%2fISSREW.2018.00-29&partnerID=40&md5=edd405ca27bd2630713830a0a5d1d2a3, 
Visualization Tool for Designing Microservices with the Monolith-First Approach,"Nakazawa R., Ueda T., Enoki M., Horii H.","Proceedings - 6th IEEE Working Conference on Software Visualization, VISSOFT 2018",2018,32,42,,"The microservice architecture is essential for agile development and deployment of the application components; however, designing microservices for a web application is not a straight-forward task. One of the best ways to design microservices is to decompose a monolithic prototype of an application into microservices on the basis of both the complexity in engineering and the component boundaries of the application in the early phase of development. We propose a visualization tool allowing developers to interactively design microservice applications on the basis of the characteristics of source codes and the behaviors of a monolithic prototype. This visualization tool first constructs a calling-context tree from profile data taken in a dry-run of the application. Next, it generates an initial microservice design while considering keyword features in the source codes or amount of function calls between components. Developers can interactively refine this design via this visual interface by taking four-choice actions to revise boundaries of microservices while considering expected communications between them. This interaction will have a significant impact on runtime performance. Case studies of two open-source benchmark applications demonstrate the proposed tool enables interactive design of microservices. The results of the demonstration show that compared to the official microservice designs of the applications, the proposed tool can effectively design microservice applications. © 2018 IEEE.", , ,10.1109/VISSOFT.2018.00012,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85058438106&doi=10.1109%2fVISSOFT.2018.00012&partnerID=40&md5=653213654c0fa509bfe28ce7113aebba, 
Office Chromatography: Miniaturized All-in-One Open-Source System for Planar Chromatography,"Fichou D., Morlock G.E.",Analytical Chemistry,2018,12647,12654,,"Current high-performance-thin-layer-chromatography instrumentation is offline and stepwise automated. However, moderate miniaturization offers many advantages and together with the transfer of modern print and media technologies to the field of chromatography (office chromatography) it opens up new avenues. This is demonstrated in an all-in-one open-source system developed for planar chromatography and especially for ultrathin-layer chromatography. Using an InkShield board to control a thermal inkjet cartridge, picoliter drops were printed at a resolution of 96 dpi on the adsorbent layer. Using Marlin, a popular firmware in 3D printing, Cartesian movement of the print head was made possible for full control of the printing process. Open-source software was developed to control the device in each operation step. Sample solutions and mobile phase were inkjet-printed, exemplarily shown for the analysis of dye- or paraben-mixture solutions. Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) were investigated for documentation. For example, deep UV LEDs gave access to 254 nm light, and RGB LEDs gave access to the visible-light range. Calibration functions with correlation coefficients superior to 0.999 were obtained by videodensitometry. The developed modular open-source hardware was compact (26 × 31 × 26 cm 3 ), light (&lt;3 kg), and affordable (€810).

Tough choices for an agile open source international development project: the Libre LAS Case,"McDowell A., Drechsler A.",Journal of Information Technology Teaching Cases,2018,139,148,,"In June 2010, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations (UN) started a three-year trust fund project to develop and pilot open source cadastre and registration software. This project was called Libre Land Administration System (Libre LAS), and its aim was to make computerised cadastre and registration systems more affordable and more sustainable in developing countries. The first stage of the Libre LAS project was undertaken at FAO headquarters (HQ) in Rome. Generic cadastre and registration processes were defined and software requirements and software architecture documents prepared. Development of the Libre LAS software began in early 2011. An international team of software developers assembled at FAO HQ and proceeded to create the generic software platform using an Agile Scrum methodology. By early 2012, the first release of Libre LAS was ready and pilot implementations began in Ghana, Nepal, and Samoa to validate and prove the Libre LAS concept. This case study tracks the initial development and implementation of Libre LAS in the pilot countries from 2011 to late 2012. It is presented from the standpoint of Brett, the Libre LAS Project Coordinator, and discusses organisational, cultural, stakeholder, and financial issues that conspired to derail the project. Ultimately, Brett is left to make some tough decisions around the pilot implementations to ensure the success of the overall project. © 2017, Association for Information Technology Trust.", , ,10.1057/s41266-017-0032-4,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85035324428&doi=10.1057%2fs41266-017-0032-4&partnerID=40&md5=ef3f0a9aad24617e207d0963ed6a42f5,

These lean processes are based either on agile strategies or in open source environments. One instance of this trend is the growing use of GitHub as a software construction platform. More and more, software developers are relying on text as representation and collaboration as a way of producing quality software. As such, the adoption of more abstract representations (model oriented), as the research community have been forecasting, is yet to happen. Taking a bias position, anchored on the concept of transparency as a quality, we look at the factors for the prevalence of code over models.

Effort Estimation via Text Classification and Autoencoders,Soares R.G.F.,Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks,2018,,,,"The estimation of the effort required for the production of a software or the correction of a software issue is an important activity in software development methodologies. Such estimates are essential to the delivery of high-quality products within a time frame and budget. Intuitively, these estimates should be produced as early as possible in the development process in order to improve planning. Issue reports are the earliest documents available for the correction of a software. We tackle effort estimation in early stages of agile software development as text classification of issue reports. This task consists of assigning categories to such documents, often written in natural language and programming code. Typically, text classification is performed with feature extraction techniques that produce informative features for a text classifier. Autoencoders generate input representations in increasing levels of abstraction, which may represent meaningful semantics in issue reports. We propose a study on the effectiveness of autoencoders for estimating the effort required for the agile correction of software functionalities in the context of real-world open-source projects. Our experiments provided significant evidences that autoencoders are able to encode noisy documents and provide informative features to a text classifier and improve its generalization. © 2018 IEEE.", , ,10.1109/IJCNN.2018.8489030,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85056557747&doi=10.1109%2fIJCNN.2018.8489030&partnerID=40&md5=503c062b1222515cd4d0c2e158f508f4, 
Numerical Implementation and validation of turbulent premixed combustion model for lean mixtures,"Muppala S., Madhav Rao V.C.",MATEC Web of Conferences,2018,,,,"The present paper discusses the numerical investigation of turbulent premixed flames under lean conditions. Lean premixed combustion, a low NOx emission technique but are prone to instabilities, extinction and blow out. Such flames are influenced by preferential diffusion due to different mass diffusivities of reactants and difference between heat and mass diffusivities in the reaction zone. In this numerical study, we estimate non-reacting flow characteristics with implementation of an Algebraic Flame Surface Wrinkling Model (AFSW) in the open source CFD code OpenFOAM. In these flows, the mean velocity fields and recirculation zones were captured reasonably well by the RANS standard k-epsilon turbulence model. The simulated turbulent velocity is in good agreement with experiments in the shear-generated turbulence layer. The reacting flow study was done at three equivalence ratios of 0.43, 0.5 and 0.56 to gauge the ability of numerical model to predict combustion quantities. At equivalence ratios 0.5 and 0.56 the simulations showed numerical oscillations and non-convergence of the turbulent quantities. This leads to a detailed parametric variation study where, the pre-constant of AFSW model is varied with values 0.3, 0.35 and 0.4. However the study revealed the weak dependence of pre-constant value on the equivalence ratio. Hence the pre-constant value is fit for specific equivalence ratio based on the parametric variation study. The tuned AFSW model with fitted pre-constant specific to given equivalence ratio predicted are compared with experiments and discussed. The tuned AFSW model produced turbulent flame speed values which are good agreement with experiments. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.", , ,10.1051/matecconf/201820900004,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055550360&doi=10.1051%2fmatecconf%2f201820900004&partnerID=40&md5=9c62ff4dc4a75abb07ddbcbce6d0c5ae, 
User-centered design and usability testing of RxMAGIC: a prescription management and general inventory control system for free clinic dispensaries,"Fisher A.M., Mtonga T.M., Espino J.U., Jonkman L.J., Connor S.E., Cappella N.K., Douglas G.P.",BMC health services research,2018,703,,,"BACKGROUND: To address challenges related to medication management in underserved settings, we developed a system for Prescription Management And General Inventory Control, or RxMAGIC, in collaboration with the Birmingham Free Clinic in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. RxMAGIC is an interoperable, web-based medication management system designed to standardize and streamline the dispensing practice and improve inventory control in a free clinic setting. This manuscript describes the processes used to design, develop, and deploy RxMAGIC. METHODS: We transformed data from previously performed mixed-methods needs assessment studies into functional user requirements using agile development methods. Requirements took the form of user stories that were prioritized to drive implementation of RxMAGIC as a web-application. A functional prototype was developed and tested to understand its perceived usefulness before developing a production system. Prior to deployment, we evaluated the usability of RxMAGIC with six users to diagnose potential interaction challenges that may be avoided through redesign. The results from this study were similarly prioritized and informed the final features of the production system. RESULTS: We developed 45 user stories that acted as functional requirements to incrementally build RxMAGIC. Integrating with the electronic health record at the clinic was a requirement for deployment. We utilized health data standards to communicate with the existing order entry system; an outgoing electronic prescribing framework was leveraged to send prescription data to RxMAGIC. The results of the usability study were positive, with all tested features receiving a mean score of four or five (i.e. somewhat easy or easy, respectively) on a five-point Likert scale assessing ease of completion, thus demonstrating the system's simplicity and high learnability. RxMAGIC was deployed at the clinic in October 2016 over a two-week period. CONCLUSIONS: We built RxMAGIC, an open-source, pharmacist-facing dispensary management information system that augments the pharmacist's ability to efficiently deliver medication services in a free clinic setting.

Here Ember, a new open-source code for efficiently performing these calculations using large, detailed chemical kinetic models is presented. Ember outperforms other standard software, such as Chemkin, in computation time by leveraging rebalanced Strang operator splitting which does not suffer the steady-state inaccuracies of most splitting methods. The splitting approach and implementation used in Ember are described. Ember is validated for computation of flame extinction through imposed strain, extinction strain rate (ESR), and shown to be capable of modeling three typical experimental strained flame configurations: premixed twin flames, premixed single flames opposing inert, and diffusion flames. As further demonstration, Ember is used to investigate Lewis number effects on ESR using a detailed chemical kinetic model with 500 species for simulation of strained extinction of lean (Le > 1) and rich (Le < 1) propane/air flames. Primary trends predicted by Law (2006) using asymptotic theories of strained flames are accurately reproduced with the large, detailed chemical kinetic model.

Transfer of learning simulates multi-criteria case indexing, refined from knowledge induction derived from analyses of random but related cases based on search strategies. Randomization of the search space encourages emergence of heuristic solutions, fuzzy though informed transfers and further refinement of schema. We investigate the type of navigational structures/design resulting from creative reuse/refactoring and lean management; and whether there will be evidences of knowledge induction from randomized search scaffolded by Case-based Reasoning (CBR), which leads to heuristic transfer and learning.

"tinyLTE: Light weight, Ad Hoc deployable cellular network for vehicular communication","Eckermann F., Gorczak P., Wietfeld C.",IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference,2018,1,5,,"The application of LTE technology has evolved from infrastructure-based deployments in licensed bands to new use cases covering ad hoc, device-to-device communications and unlicensed band operation. Vehicular communication is an emerging field of particular interest for LTE, covering in our understanding both automotive (cars) as well as unmanned aerial vehicles. Existing commercial equipment is designed for infrastructure making it unsuitable for vehicular applications requiring low weight and unlicensed band support (e.g. 5.9 GHz ITS-band). In this work, we present tinyLTE, a system design which provides fully autonomous, multi-purpose and ultra-compact LTE cells by utilizing existing open source eNB and EPC implementations. Due to its small form factor and low weight, the tinyLTE system enables mobile deployment on board of cars and drones as well as smooth integration with existing roadside infrastructure. Additionally, the standalone design allows for systems to be chained in a multi-hop configuration. The paper describes the lean and low-cost design concept and implementation followed by a performance evaluation for single and two-hop configurations at 5.9 GHz.

Comparative study of the aerodynamic performances of motorcycle racing wheels using numerical cfd simulations,"Concli F., Gobbi M., Gorla C.",WIT Transactions on Engineering Sciences,2018,185,191,,"In motorcycle competitions, aerodynamics play a fundamental role. In order to improve the performance of racing motorbikes, different front-wheel geometries have been studied by means of numerical CFD simulations. Different lean angles were analysed for each geometry and the air motion-field were calculated. The considered geometries range from standard spoked design to solid wheels. Both steady-state and dynamic simulations were run using the open-source free software OpenFOAM®. This open-source code was selected because, like all the computer programs of this type, it allows a higher flexibility with respect to any close-source commercial software, allowing a customization of the code by implementing specific models for the analysis of the physical problem of interest and also, at the same time, a higher parallelization of the computations. Steady-state simulations were performed using a rotating reference frame (MRF) while, for the transients, a partially-rotating mesh was adopted, thus taking advantage of the internal sliding interfaces (AMI).

In this paper, we propose a multi-objective search-based approach to support the team in making such a decision. Our approach employs evolutionary techniques to iteratively generate candidate selections of issues for a given iteration, and search for the optimal selection(s). The search is guided simultaneously by two objectives: maximizing the business value which the team delivers in the iteration while maximizing the alignment with regard to the iteration's original goal.

The patch-flow method for measuring inner source collaboration,"Capraro M., Dorner M., Riehle D.",Proceedings - International Conference on Software Engineering,2018,515,525,,"Inner source (IS) is the use of open source software development (SD) practices and the establishment of an open source-like culture within an organization. IS enables and requires developers to collaborate more than traditional SD methods such as plan-driven or agile development. To better understand IS, researchers and practitioners need to measure IS collaboration. However, there is no method yet for doing so. In this paper, we present a method for measuring IS collaboration by measuring the patch-flow within an organization. Patch-flow is the flow of code contributions across organizational boundaries such as project, organizational unit, or profit center boundaries. We evaluate our patch-flow measurement method using case study research with a software developing multi-industry company. By applying the method in the case organization, we evaluate its relevance and viability and discuss its usefulness. We found that about half (47.9%) of all code contributions constitute patch-flow between organizational units, almost all (42.2%) being between organizational units working on different products. Such significant patch-flow indicates high relevance of the patch-flow phenomenon and hence the method presented in this paper. Our patch-flow measurement method is the first of its kind to measure and quantify IS collaboration. It can serve as a base for further quantitative analyses of IS collaboration. © 2018 ACM.", , ,10.1145/3196398.3196417,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85051658269&doi=10.1145%2f3196398.3196417&partnerID=40&md5=fb2624bfb2e89bb1928bdd11990dd59e, 
Near real-time collaborative modeling for view-based Web information systems engineering,"Nicolaescu P., Rosenstengel M., Derntl M., Klamma R., Jarke M.",Information Systems,2018,23,39,,"Conceptual modeling is a creative, social process driven by the views of stakeholders. In modern, agile development – especially for continuously evolving Web applications – contributions from a wide variety of geographically distributed stakeholders, their involvement in negotiation and impact analysis from different perspectives and the rapid prototype generation from specifications gain much importance. Moreover, people have come to expect easy near real-time system support with few restrictions. While conceptual modeling or CSCW environments exist for each of these individual aspects, their interplay has barely been studied. This paper presents a collaborative conceptual modeling approach called SyncMeta that aims to close this gap by supporting view-based modeling in the Web browser in a near real-time shared editing environment1. In addition to domain-specific graphical modeling languages, viewpoints can be collaboratively defined on the meta-modeling layer and instantiated as views within a model editor instance. Besides this formal structure, we also discuss the choice of algorithms for locking-free shared model editing and of highly scalable team size. In addition to this kind of technical evaluation, the paper also presents several medium-scale user studies that have accompanied the iterative SyncMeta development. These studies investigated both the requirements (quality advantages and user acceptance of the view-based approach, near real-time support) and important design options such as centralized vs. peer-to-peer viewpoint resolution. A fully functional SyncMeta software framework which incorporates most of these results, is available in the GitHub open source repository.

Agile acceptance test-driven development of clinical decision support advisories: Feasibility of using open source software,"Basit M.A., Baldwin K.L., Kannan V., Flahaven E.L., Parks C.J., Ott J.M., Willett D.L.",Journal of Medical Internet Research,2018,,,,"Background: Moving to electronic health records (EHRs) confers substantial benefits but risks unintended consequences. Modern EHRs consist of complex software code with extensive local configurability options, which can introduce defects. Defects in clinical decision support (CDS) tools are surprisingly common. Feasible approaches to prevent and detect defects in EHR configuration, including CDS tools, are needed. In complex software systems, use of test-driven development and automated regression testing promotes reliability. Test-driven development encourages modular, testable design and expanding regression test coverage. Automated regression test suites improve software quality, providing a “safety net” for future software modifications. Each automated acceptance test serves multiple purposes, as requirements (prior to build), acceptance testing (on completion of build), regression testing (once live), and “living” design documentation. Rapid-cycle development or “agile” methods are being successfully applied to CDS development. The agile practice of automated test-driven development is not widely adopted, perhaps because most EHR software code is vendor-developed. However, key CDS advisory configuration design decisions and rules stored in the EHR may prove amenable to automated testing as “executable requirements.” Objective: We aimed to establish feasibility of acceptance test-driven development of clinical decision support advisories in a commonly used EHR, using an open source automated acceptance testing framework (FitNesse). Methods: Acceptance tests were initially constructed as spreadsheet tables to facilitate clinical review. Each table specified one aspect of the CDS advisory's expected behavior. Table contents were then imported into a test suite in FitNesse, which queried the EHR database to automate testing. Tests and corresponding CDS configuration were migrated together from the development environment to production, with tests becoming part of the production regression test suite. Results: We used test-driven development to construct a new CDS tool advising Emergency Department nurses to perform a swallowing assessment prior to administering oral medication to a patient with suspected stroke. Test tables specified desired behavior for (1) applicable clinical settings, (2) triggering action, (3) rule logic, (4) user interface, and (5) system actions in response to user input. Automated test suite results for the “executable requirements” are shown prior to building the CDS alert, during build, and after successful build. Conclusions: Automated acceptance test-driven development and continuous regression testing of CDS configuration in a commercial EHR proves feasible with open source software. Automated test-driven development offers one potential contribution to achieving high-reliability EHR configuration. Vetting acceptance tests with clinicians elicits their input on crucial configuration details early during initial CDS design and iteratively during rapid-cycle optimization. © Mujeeb A Basit, Krystal L Baldwin, Vaishnavi Kannan, Emily L Flahaven, Cassandra J Parks, Jason M Ott, Duwayne L Willett.", , ,10.2196/medinform.9679,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85047773973&doi=10.2196%2fmedinform.9679&partnerID=40&md5=c961eef60ea817c9b4c756ebd8e53ba2,

Non-linear Interactions of Two Premixed Flames Explored by Large Eddy Simulation with External Acoustic Forcing,"Han X., Morgans A.S.",Combustion Science and Technology,2018,424,435,,"This article describes a numerical study of the interactions between two lean premixed flames subjected to external acoustic forcing. This provides insights into the flame-to-flame interactions that may occur during combustion instability in annular combustors. Experimental measurements for comparison are available from the target combustor developed at Cambridge University (Worth and Dawson, 2012). Large eddy simulation is applied using the open source computational fluid dynamics toolbox, OpenFOAM, with the combustion modeled using the partially stirred reactor model with a four-step chemical reaction mechanism for methane/air. Harmonic velocity oscillations are imposed at the inlet; the flame responses are studied based on heat release rate signals in different combustion regions. The effect of the flame separation distance (Sd) on both the flame dynamics and unsteady heat release responses is analyzed. The results show that the flame-to-flame interactions are nonlinear for the flame separations studied. The spatial variation of the unsteady heat release rate demonstrates that flame-wall interactions play an important role, becoming even more important than flame-to-flame interactions for closely spaced flames (Sd &lt; 2.00D). These findings imply that for the flame separation distances studied, any flame model used in the low-order annular combustion instability prediction should account for both nonlinearity and flame-to-flame interactions. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.", , ,10.1080/00102202.2017.1398148,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85034215871&doi=10.1080%2f00102202.2017.1398148&partnerID=40&md5=c106d45dea68425571e588f01c33ed1a,

Low-fidelity prototyping with simple collaborative tabletop computer-aided design systems,"Kaya E., Alacam S., Findik Y., Balcisoy S.",Computers and Graphics (Pergamon),2018,307,315,,"Design processes encompass iterative elaboration and elimination of new and many ideas gathered from a wide range of resources. The higher the diversity of the resources, the higher the chances that the design process will bear expected outcomes. Following that idea, immense amount of effort has been devoted to the development of collaborative computer-aided design (CAD) systems, and process frameworks that drive those systems. We infer from the existing literature that collaborative CAD solution attempts involve holistic approaches in which all aspects of the problem (social and technical) are being addressed. As an attempt to address social and physical aspects of the problem, tabletop systems with complex structures have been proposed by the previous work. Unfortunately, such complexity comes with the lack of reproducibility of the research work, and high evaluation overhead per prototype imposing a low limit on the number of design ideas to be investigated. Sophisticated systems might be required to solve the real-world problems, however, we argue that, with simple setups, rapid collaborative iterative prototyping could be achieved. Such simple setups could lead to high number of good ideas ready to be fed into off-the-shelf CAD systems lacking adequate support for collaborative design. We realized and evaluated this idea by implementing a tangible tabletop collaborative design system that facilitates fast and iterative prototype production for residential area design. Based on the case studies conducted with this setup, we show that synchronous collaboration for rapid prototyping could be achieved with lean setups, provide a list of design recommendations for such systems that we derive from our case study observations and existing literature, and finally contribute to the community with an open source tangible tabletop installation tool kit. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd", , ,10.1016/j.cag.2017.07.026,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85026490565&doi=10.1016%2fj.cag.2017.07.026&partnerID=40&md5=17b378ac36a7894edf27c5fc6247de67, 
Tracing project development in Scrum model,"Dobrzyński B., Sosnowski J.",Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,2018,,,,Agile software development and management related to Scrum model is gaining popularity. It may differ significantly from classical development schemes widely discussed in the literature. An interesting issue is to evaluate project progress and the effectiveness of task handling in Scrum based development. This process can be supported with an advanced study of repositories provided by issue tracking and project management software. This is neglected in publications on Scrum methodology. In the paper we present some original analysis schemes which have been verified using repository data from a commercial project involving developers from multiple sites. In the presented approach we exploit our experience with other development techniques targeted at big and complex open source or commercial projects.

“Computing” Requirements for Open Source Software: A Distributed Cognitive Approach,"Xiao X., Lindberg A., Hansen S., Lyytinen K.",Journal of the Association for Information Systems,2018,1217,1252,,"Most requirements engineering (RE) research has been conducted in the context of structured and agile software development. Software, however, is increasingly developed in open source software (OSS) forms which have several unique characteristics. In this study, we approach OSS RE as a sociotechnical, distributed cognitive process where distributed actors “compute” requirements— i.e., transform requirements-related knowledge into forms that foster a shared understanding of what the software is going to do and how it can be implemented. Such computation takes place through social sharing of knowledge and the use of heterogeneous artifacts. To illustrate the value of this approach, we conduct a case study of a popular OSS project, Rubinius—a runtime environment for the Ruby programming language—and identify ways in which cognitive workload associated with RE becomes distributed socially, structurally, and temporally across actors and artifacts. We generalize our observations into an analytic framework of OSS RE, which delineates three stages of requirements computation: excavation, instantiation, and testing-in-the-wild. We show how the distributed, dynamic, and heterogeneous computational structure underlying OSS development builds an effective mechanism for managing requirements. Our study contributes to sorely needed theorizing of appropriate RE processes within highly distributed environments as it identifies and articulates several novel mechanisms that undergird cognitive processes associated with distributed forms of RE. © 2018 by the Association for Information Systems.", , ,10.17705/1jais.00525,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85061966065&doi=10.17705%2f1jais.00525&partnerID=40&md5=15ad132a3a0f8327a8a4c4f627a3fc14,

A case study to compare regression test selection techniques on open-source software projects,"Yilmaz U., Tarhan A.",CEUR Workshop Proceedings,2018,,,,"Regression testing is the type of testing performed on a modified software to validate integrated parts are functioning properly. Especially with agile development practices being increasingly used, regression testing needs to be fast and practical enough to coexist with the nature of agile development. To satisfy this need, Regression Test Selection (RTS) techniques are proposed to reduce number of tests. Although there are many studies analyzing these techniques and their effectiveness in terms of the number of reduced tests, time and cost; the applicability and practicality aspects have been mostly neglected. To this end, in this paper a case study is carried out to compare highly cited and mostly used RTS techniques.

Review of formal agile methods as cost-effective airworthiness certification processes,"Blooshi M.A., Jafer S., Patel K.",Journal of Aerospace Information Systems,2018,471,484,,"SAFETY-CRITICAL software systems are part of our daily life and any error in these systems can result in catastrophic consequences, with the worst-case scenario being loss of human life. Therefore, a rigorous safety certification process is needed to prove the correctness and reliability of such systems. The purpose of the certification process is to ensure that the system to be used in a specific environment under specific conditions is safe. To make these software systems trustworthy and more reliable, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is imposing safety requirements on the development and verification of airborne avionic systems as stated in the DO-178 [1] (“Software Considerations in Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification”) guidance document developed by the Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics, Inc. and the European Organisation for Civil Aviation Equipment (EUROCAE; a nonprofit organization providing a European forum for resolving technical problems with electronic equipment for air transport). The latest DO-178C guidance includes modern technologies and methodologies necessary to achieve a more reliable and safe system within a constrained time and cost. The DO-178C guidance document also describes various guidelines to engineer (design, specify, develop, test, and deploy) a software component and all associated equipment with a certain level of safety that complies with the FAA airworthiness requirements [2]. Although these standards define the requirements for a process to remain compliant when used to develop a safety-critical system, the standards do not specify which process to use. Thus, software developers can use any preferred processes if they meets the objectives and safety standards of DO-178C, which in our case leave us with an option to then use Agile, formal methods, and model-based development (MBD) [3,4] with all their associated advantages in the certification and development process. The agile software development process is a set of practices and methods that are based on the values and principles expressed in the agile manifesto established on 17 February 2001 [5]. These methods take an iterative and lean development approach that emphasizes the rapid development of a minimum viable product and frequent releases of the software, producing high-quality code and reducing process overhead and direct involvement of the customer in the development process. Agile is significantly accepted in the industry but not as widely accepted in safety-critical systems development because of its undisciplined nature when it comes to documentation and the lack of rigorous verification and validation techniques. One study suggests that using the Agile process as a standalone method to develop a safety-critical system has proven to be a failure because of the quality control mechanisms used by Agile such as informal reviews and pair programming, which have not assured developers or authorities that the product is safe [6]. However, the study also suggests that using Agile can deliberately reduce the complexity on the aircraft development process and evolutionary technology used [7]. The study suggests using project awareness to handle the process complexity and open-source tools to start processes from the second half of the development life cycle earlier in order to detect and react to possible blockers as soon as possible. Scaling agile methods for large systems is hard and, in handling this issue, the study suggests using virtual simulation and testing that will reduce system complexity, save the budget, and get early feedback about the system. However, critical systems need upfront design, exhaustive documentation, and continuous integration, which is practically challenging when using Agile. Therefore, the aviation industry avoids applying Agile in the development process. © 2018 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc..

Lean tools and techniques are becoming essential to eliminate or minimize waste and non-value activities from the manufacturing process.

Many manufacturing organizations are inefficiently using Lean tools, considering that Lean brings benefits despite the nature of implemented tools; most of these organizations are experiencing failure. To solve this issue, we proposed a Co-Simulation system, based on an assembly line sample in an Aeronautic industry, to help predict the effect of a Lean tool on the Manufacturing process, according to specific economic context factors.

Coming from classical software development processes, many existing approaches rather enforce a top-down structure instead of supporting a cyclic approach that integrates smoother with modern agile development. State-of-the-art MDWE should integrate established and emerging Web development features, such as (near real-time) collaborative modeling and shared editing on the generated code. The challenge when covering these requirements lies with synchronizing source code and models, an essential need to cope with regular changes in the software architecture and provide the fiexibility needed for agile MDWE. In this paper, we present an approach that enables cyclic, collaborative development of Web applications by using traceability in model-to-text transformations to deal with the synchronization.

Aerodynamic design system for non-axisymmetric boundary layer ingestion fans,"Kumar S., Turner M.G., Siddappaji K., Celestina M.",Proceedings of the ASME Turbo Expo,2018,,,,"Non-uniformities at the engine inlet call for novel design techniques to cater to the performance and aeromechanical challenges. The purpose of the fan system is to mitigate the effects of distortion in the flow and to provide thrust to the vehicle. This paper discusses a harmonic based open source design system (NAX) and demonstrates its capabilities for applications in a boundary layer ingesting fan system. First, a primary baseline design was obtained using a typical axisymmetric design approach for the rotor and OGV (Outlet Guide Vanes). This baseline design now serves as the basis for further development, based on user-defined design features. Subsequently, using this baseline design, a circumferentially non-axisymmetric design of the OGV is obtained by means of inducing perturbations in blade leading edge metal angles using Fourier coefficients and phase values. The other parameters that can be varied radially as Bezier curves and tangentially as Fourier modes are: Trailing edge metal angle, chord, lean, sweep, curvature and thickness. A smooth spanwise curvature controlled 3D design of OGV is discussed using the opensource geometry generator, T-Blade3. The OGV geometry files along with the detailed documentation are also available for download on the T-Blade3 website and NAX source code on Github website. This design is further optimized to improve the non-axisymmetric geometric distribution against the distorted flow conditions. The design system proposed here helps in exploration of user-specified parametric design space for development of a non-axisymmetric fan stage. Further, since the design system is modular in nature, it can easily be integrated at multiple process levels for other types of turbomachinery design applications. © 2018 ASME.", , ,10.1115/GT201877042,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054056908&doi=10.1115%2fGT201877042&partnerID=40&md5=64ca270072ea45600851ade4b20378d3,

Experiment feedback on a microservices architecture,"Sordi M., Heulet D.","15th International Conference on Space Operations, 2018",2018,,,,"The CNES (Centre National d’Etudes Spatiales, French Space Agency) gave to CSSI the responsibility of the development of REGARDS, a data valorization product which can be used as a true COTS component of Ground Segment. REGARDS is highly flexible to various themes, modular, efficient, long-lasting, evolutionary and scalable. It aims at providing services to Mission Centers and laboratories, and is able to deal with a huge amount of data. REGARDS is already intended to be the CNES archival component for plasma physics, optical, altimetry, etc. data centers. The System design leans on the OAIS (Open Archival Information System) recommendation of the CCSDS (Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems). Consequently, the System allows high-performance ingestion of data and metadata available from providers, either in standard or non-standard formats. In this way, it allows to valorize metadata through upgrade and to provide them to the community thanks to standard protocols of interoperability and advanced search interface (Open search Geo, Faceted search, multiple geospatial projection support). It also offers functionalities which allow long-term data and metadata storage, to ease the system administration in a simple and ergonomic way, to launch back-end processing through standards protocols (WPS, UWS), and to be supervised. REGARDS is an Open Source solution and integrates Open Source COTS (GPLv3 license), which allows a strong commitment of user community in the development of modules and plugins, through a community portal able to manage bugs and evolution requests, backed by a complete and easy-to-use documentation.

Effect of wall heat transfer on the flame response to acoustic perturbation in a turbulent swirling combustor,"Xia Y., Laera D., Morgans A.S.","25th International Congress on Sound and Vibration 2018, ICSV 2018: Hiroshima Calling",2018,2025,2032,,"This article presents a numerical study of the forced flame response to acoustic perturbation in a longitudinal turbulent swirling combustor taken from an annular rig built at Cambridge University. Incompressible large eddy simulations (LES) are performed via the open source CFD-toolbox OpenFOAM, applying the partially-stirred reactor (PaSR) combustion model and a one-step global ethylene (C 2 H 4 )-air reaction scheme. A lean premixed ethylene-air flame stabilised by a bluff-body is studied in the combustor, which has a long longitudinal extension and attaches to the combustor side walls. The unforced flame is firstly simulated using uniform inflow, for which the adiabatic and non-adiabatic wall conditions are respectively applied, showing that the existence of wall heat transfer will increase the flame's longitudinal length due to heat exchange on the side walls and locally quench the flame root in the outer shear layer of the bluff-body due to the heat losses on the flame holder wall. The unforced flame is then submitted to an upstream longitudinal harmonic velocity perturbation at combustor inlet, which has a forcing frequency varying from 500 Hz to 1,000 Hz at a forcing amplitude of 10% of the mean inflow velocity. The response of flame heat release rate is then computed over time for each frequency, eventually leading to the construction of flame transfer function (FTF) that relates the linear flame response to the upstream perturbation. The simulated FTFs are compared between adiabatic and non-adiabatic wall conditions, showing that the wall heat transfer largely decreases the FTF-gain, possibly due to the oscillation of flame surface area being reduced by the heat losses on the side walls. In contrast, the heat losses will increase the absolute FTF-phase, which is because the time delay between upstream perturbation and flame response becomes larger due to the extended flame length. This study highlights the importance of correctly accounting for the wall heat transfer in order to accurately predict the flame response to acoustic perturbations in a turbulent swirling combustor.

In this paper, we present details of the construction of a melt extrusion 3D printer based on readily available open source components. Several key fabrication parameters were investigated and optimised to enable printing complex 3D objects made from chocolate. The ability of an extruded chocolate fibre to span large distances without collapsing was investigated by adjusting variables such as movement speeds, extrusion rates and cooling rates. We found that the chocolate spanning distance was unaffected by movement speeds ranging from 300 to 700 mm/min, and that the optimal extrusion rate was 10–20% leaner. Furthermore, the spanning distance improved by directing air across the printing part, lowering the air temperature by approximately 3.5 °C.

Multi-objective search-based approach to estimate issue resolution time,"Abbood Al-Zubaidi W.H., Dam H.K., Ghose A., Li X.",ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2017,53,62,,"Background: Resolving issues is central to modern agile software development where a software is developed and evolved incrementally through series of issue resolutions. An issue could represent a requirement for a new functionality, a report of a software bug or a description of a project task. Aims: Knowing how long an issue will be resolved is thus important to di?erent stakeholders including end-users, bug reporters, bug triagers, developers and managers. This paper aims to propose a multi-objective search-based approach to estimate the time required for resolving an issue. Methods: Using genetic programming (a meta-heuristic optimization method), we iteratively generate candidate estimate models and search for the optimal model in estimating issue resolution time. The search is guided simultaneously by two objectives: maximizing the accuracy of the estimation model while minimizing its complexity. Results: Our evaluation on 8,260 issues from five large open source projects demonstrate that our approach significantly (p < 0.001) outperforms both the baselines and state-of-the-art techniques.

We also present desirable characteristics of vulnerability benchmarks and repositories that we uncovered while creating Ghera. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.

A tale of CI build failures: An open source and a financial organization perspective,"Vassallo C., Schermann G., Zampetti F., Romano D., Leitner P., Zaidman A., Di Penta M., Panichella S.","Proceedings - 2017 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution, ICSME 2017",2017,183,193,,"Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) are widespread in both industrial and open-source software (OSS) projects. Recent research characterized build failures in CI and identified factors potentially correlated to them. However, most observations and findings of previous work are exclusively based on OSS projects or data from a single industrial organization. This paper provides a first attempt to compare the CI processes and occurrences of build failures in 349 Java OSS projects and 418 projects from a financial organization, ING Nederland. Through the analysis of 34, 182 failing builds (26% of the total number of observed builds), we derived a taxonomy of failures that affect the observed CI processes. Using cluster analysis, we observed that in some cases OSS and ING projects share similar build failure patterns (e.g., few compilation failures as compared to frequent testing failures), while in other cases completely different patterns emerge. In short, we explain how OSS and ING CI processes exhibit commonalities, yet are substantially different in their design and in the failures they report. © 2017 IEEE.", , ,10.1109/ICSME.201767,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85040637055&doi=10.1109%2fICSME.201767&partnerID=40&md5=e1382b8a205c0049a8e5534ed58051c5, 
Towards Requirements Reuse by Implementing Traceability in Agile Development,"Elamin R., Osman R.",Proceedings - International Computer Software and Applications Conference,2017,431,436,,"Requirements reusability within agile development improves software quality and team productivity. One method to implement requirements reusability is traceability, in which relations and dependencies between requirements and artifacts are identified and linked. In this paper, we propose a semiautomated methodology to implement traceability in the agile development process in order to achieve requirements reusability. The main feature of our methodology is the coupling of semi-automated semantic trace generation with the outputs of the agile development process, thus facilitating requirements and artifact reuse. In contrast to previous work, this methodology is specifically designed for practical agile processes and artifacts. Our methodology will be implemented as a component within an existing open source agile tool in order to have minimal impact on the development process.

With the adoption of Agile development methodology, the number of tests and software revisions has dramatically increased, and hence has the cost of regression testing. Researchers proposed regression test selection (RTS) techniques that optimize regression testing by skipping tests that are not impacted by recent program changes. Ekstazi is one such state-of-the art technique; Ekstazi is implemented for the Java programming language and has been adopted by several companies and open-source projects. We report on our experience implementing and evaluating Ekstazi#, an Ekstazi-like tool for .NET.We describe the key challenges of bringing the Ekstazi idea to the .NET platform. We evaluate Ekstazi# on 11 open-source projects, as well as an internal Microsoft project substantially larger than each of the open-source projects. Finally, we compare Ekstazi# to an incremental build system (also developed at Microsoft), which, out of the box, provides module-level dependency tracking and skipping tasks (including test execution) whenever dependencies of a task do not change between the current and the last successful build. Ekstazi# on average reduced regression testing time by 43.70% for the open-source projects and by 65.26% for the Microsoft project (the latter is in addition to the savings provided by incremental builds). © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.", , ,10.1145/3106237.3117763,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85030772975&doi=10.1145%2f3106237.3117763&partnerID=40&md5=747e54d238c1575068db5b5ba6a764cd,

How does contributors' involvement influence the build status of an open-source software project?,"Reboucas M., Santos R.O., Pinto G., Castor F.",IEEE International Working Conference on Mining Software Repositories,2017,475,478,,"The recent introduction of the pull-based development model promoted agile development practices such as Code Reviews and Continuous Integration (CI). CI, in particular, is currently a standard development practice in open-source software (OSS) projects. Although it is well-known that OSS contributors have different involvements (e.g., while some developers drive the project, there is a long tail of peripheral developers), little is known about how the contributor's degree of participation can influence the build status of an OSS project. Through TravisTorrent's dataset, we compare the success rates of builds made by casual and non-casual contributors and what factors on their contributions may influence the build result. Our results suggest that there is no representative difference between their build success (they are similar in 85% of the analyzed projects), meaning that being a casual contributor is not a strong indicator for creating failing builds. Also, factors like the size of their contributions and the number of project configurations (jobs) have the potential of impacting the build success. © 2017 IEEE.", , ,10.1109/MSR.2017.32,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85026514349&doi=10.1109%2fMSR.2017.32&partnerID=40&md5=ef47f3fe49dc26773ee66bb71a8b20dc,

A considerable market has developed for VR computer games and educational applications. Some solutions integrate tracked devices which allow users to freely move within a certain space. Virtual 3D model can be visually explored, implemented collision detected allows users to get a feedback for instance by sound or vibration. For research projects there are several approaches which offer to get the actual feedback for the fingers of a hand, when the users virtually touches the surface of a 3D model. However, in the consumer market currently no product is sold which offers this direct feedback for the whole hand.

It covers each of the five fingers of the user's hand, its design is open-source, low-cost, can be customized and 3D printed by individuals. It aims at improving the haptic perception of users, bases of a popular physical computing platform and is designed to be assembled even by electronically unexperienced users.

In this study we have combined an in-house digitized Big-data resource from ICU settings with Infra-red thermography to derive novel inferences about the tele-diagnostic potential of IR thermography in diagnosis of shock and perfusion disturbances. While Data-science and Big-data are expected to revolutionize the next generation medicine and healthcare, the scientific efforts towards building Big-data resources for enhancing patient safety and healthcare governance are missing, especially in developing countries. We addressed this challenge and describe our experience on deployment of Big-data warehousing and data-analytics software using lean pipelines developed using open-source technologies and their utility in deriving knowledge and high utility patterns from Affordable Infra-red Thermography. These knowledge frameworks and potentially translatable technology were developed in the Pediatric Intensive Care environment through extensive cross-talk between expert clinicians and data-scientists. In this work, we first demonstrate the successful creation of a unique Pediatric ICU resource of over 60,000 hours of continuous multivariate monitoring data followed by validation of the potential of whole body IR thermography in diagnosis of hemodynamic compromise. These patterns were validated through linear mixed models, a state-of-the-art statistical method for longitudinal data. The validated technology is affordable, and can be coupled to smartphones thus providing a huge potential in tele-medicine and electronic governance in healthcare and has the potential to be deployed in a tele-medicine setting with capturing of whole body temperature patterns by Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) workers. Therefore, this can enable early diagnosis of critical conditions such as sepsis and shock that are commonly associated with epidemics such as Dengue hemorrhagic fever in developing countries such as India.

This simple heuristic can easily be implemented as part of risk-based testing without specific prerequisites. It suits the need of small and medium enterprises as well as agile environments which have neither time nor resources for establishing elaborated approaches and procedures for data collection and analysis. To investigate the feasibility of the approach we used historical defect data from a popular open-source application. Our estimates for three consecutive versions achieved an accuracy of 73% to 78% and showed a low number of critical overestimates (<4%) and few underestimates (<1%). For practical risk-based testing such estimates provide a reliable quantitative basis that can be easily augmented with the expert knowledge of human decision-makers. Furthermore, these results also define a baseline for future research on improving probability estimation approaches. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.", , ,10.1007/978-3-319-57858-3_9,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018423010&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-319-57858-3_9&partnerID=40&md5=d50fe81fa7622561f3138511d883c035, 
Test coverage of impacted code elements for detecting refactoring faults: An exploratory study,"Alves E.L.G., Massoni T., Machado P.D.D.L.",Journal of Systems and Software,2017,223,238,,"Refactoring validation by testing is critical for quality in agile development. However, this activity may be misleading when a test suite is insufficiently robust for revealing faults. Particularly, refactoring faults can be tricky and difficult to detect. Coverage analysis is a standard practice to evaluate fault detection capability of test suites. However, there is usually a low correlation between coverage and fault detection. In this paper, we present an exploratory study on the use of coverage data of mostly impacted code elements to identify shortcomings in a test suite. We consider three real open source projects and their original test suites. The results show that a test suite not directly calling the refactored method and/or its callers increases the chance of missing the fault. Additional analysis of branch coverage on test cases shows that there are higher chances of detecting a refactoring fault when branch coverage is high. These results give evidence that a combination of impact analysis with branch coverage could be highly effective in detecting faults introduced by refactoring edits. Furthermore, we propose a statistic model that evidences the correlation of coverage over certain code elements and the suite's capability of revealing refactoring faults. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.", , ,10.1016/j.jss.2016.02.001,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84959125153&doi=10.1016%2fj.jss.2016.02.001&partnerID=40&md5=ee22a473614dc1f6b432d42b992e6268,

The furnace was operated with Dutch natural gas (DNG) at 10 kW and at an equivalence ratio of 0.8. OH∗chemiluminescence images were taken to characterize the reaction zone. The chemiluminescence intensity is relatively low compared to conventional flames and relatively uniformly distributed in the reaction zone due to the dilution effects of recirculated burnt gases. Visible flames were not observed. To characterize the dilution effects of burnt gases on reactions, flamelets generated with diluted fuel and diluted air, instead of flamelets based on pure fuel and air, were applied in an extended Flamelet Generated Manifold (FGM) approach. Burnt gases at stoichiometric mixture fraction rather than those at global equivalence ratio were considered as diluent, which is more appropriate for furnaces operating at lean condition.

Simulating flame response to acoustic excitation for an industrial gas turbine combustor,"Xia Y., Morgans A.S., Jones W.P., Han X.","24th International Congress on Sound and Vibration, ICSV 2017",2017,,,,"This work numerically investigates the unsteady heat release rate response of a full-scale industrial gas turbine combustor to acoustic perturbations. The combustor contains a lean technicallypremixed methane/air flame. Two large eddy simulation solvers are compared, the first being the in-house code BOFFIN which employs a reduced 15-step chemical reaction mechanism; the second is based on the open-source CFD toolbox OpenFOAM and applies both 2-step and 4-step reaction mechanisms. Both are incompressible codes, exploiting the fact that the flame responds to hydrodynamic perturbations excited by the acoustics. For the unforced flow-field, the simulation results agree well with the experiments. The flame heat release rate responses are calculated by applying a harmonic forcing velocity upstream to the flame across two forcing amplitudes and eight forcing frequencies. The obtained frequency responses of flame are known as flame describing functions, which are different between the solvers used, especially on their gains. This indicates that for combustors with industrial complexity, more detailed chemistry mechanisms may be necessary. The phase lags of the flame describing functions generally decrease linearly with forcing frequency, being almost independent of the forcing amplitude and the solver used.", , ,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85029432072&partnerID=40&md5=5aa2245976836a49dcc3ceb926a3087c, 
A DNS analysis of the correlation of heat release rate with chemiluminescence emissions in turbulent combustion,"Zhang F., Zirwes T., Habisreuther P., Bockhorn H.",High Performance Computing in Science and Engineering '16: Transactions of the High Performance Computing Center Stuttgart (HLRS) 2016,2017,229,243,,"The essential correlation of heat release rate and chemiluminescence emission from turbulent combustion is quantitatively analyzed by means of direct numerical simulation (DNS) of premixed methane/air flames, employing a detailed reaction mechanism with 18 species and 69 elementary reactions, and the mixtureaveraged transport method. One-dimensional freely propagating laminar flames have first been studied for different stoichiometries varying from fuel-lean to fuel-rich conditions. There, the local generation of the chemiluminescent OH* species correlates strongly with the heat released by the combustion reaction, especially in the fuel-lean range. Three-dimensional DNS have then been applied to calculate a synthetically propagating flame front subjected to different turbulent inflow conditions. Joint probability density functions of OH* concentration and heat release rate have been generated from the DNS results, showing a stronger scattering of the correlation curve compared to the corresponding laminar flame. As the chemiluminescence measurement gathers light only along one viewing direction, the line-of-sight integrated values of heat release and OH* concentration have been evaluated from the DNS, where the domain has been decomposed into a number of rays defined by a fixed viewing direction and a specific area. A quasilinear relationship has been identified for these integral values, where the correlation becomes stronger for flames subjected to lower turbulence intensities or larger crosssection areas of the rays. A computational grid with 16 million finite volumes has been used for the DNS of the turbulent flames and the simulations have been performed in parallel with 3, 600 processor cores from the Hazel Hen cluster of HLRS.

Using telephony data to facilitate discovery of clinical workflows,Rucker D.W.,Applied Clinical Informatics,2017,381,395,,"Background: Discovery of clinical workflows to target for redesign using methods such as Lean and Six Sigma is difficult. VoIP telephone call pattern analysis may complement direct observation and EMR-based tools in understanding clinical workflows at the enterprise level by allowing visualization of institutional telecommunications activity. Objective: To build an analytic framework mapping repetitive and high-volume telephone call patterns in a large medical center to their associated clinical units using an enterprise unified communications server log file and to support visualization of specific call patterns using graphical networks. Methods: Consecutive call detail records from the medical center’s unified communications server were parsed to cross-correlate telephone call patterns and map associated phone numbers to a cost center dictionary. Hashed data structures were built to allow construction of edge and node files representing high volume call patterns for display with an open source graph network tool. Results: Summary statistics for an analysis of exactly one week’s call detail records at a large academic medical center showed that 912,386 calls were placed with a total duration of 23,186 hours. Approximately half of all calling called number pairs had an average call duration under 60 seconds and of these the average call duration was 27 seconds. Conclusions: Cross-correlation of phone calls identified by clinical cost center can be used to generate graphical displays of clinical enterprise communications. Many calls are short. The compact data transfers within short calls may serve as automation or re-design targets. The large absolute amount of time medical center employees were engaged in VoIP telecommunications suggests that analysis of telephone call patterns may offer additional insights into core clinical workflows. © Schattauer 2017.", , ,10.4338/ACI-2016-11-RA-0191,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018876402&doi=10.4338%2fACI-2016-11-RA-0191&partnerID=40&md5=2695133ec61d7efb11e3641bec9f482e,

LES investigation of two frequency effects on acoustically forced premixed flame,"Han X., Yang J., Mao J.",Fuel,2016,449,459,,"Turbulent lean premixed combustion has high potentials for the development of modern low nitrogen oxide gas turbines. However, it renders the combustor prone to combustion instabilities. The non-linear response of turbulent premixed flame to external acoustic forcing plays a dominant role in the development of combustion instability. The present work describes a numerical study investigating the two frequency effects on the non-linear responses and interactions of lean premixed ethylene/air flame externally forced by strong inlet velocity oscillations. The target case is a bluff body stabilized premixed turbulent flame. Large Eddy Simulation (LES) is performed using a low-Mach number solver based on the open source CFD toolbox, OpenFOAM. The lean combustion is modelled using the Partially Stirred Reactor (PaSR) combustion model combining a reduced two-step chemical reaction mechanism. Both the unforced and forced reactive flows with single frequency forcing are simulated in order to validate the computational method. On the basis, the velocity oscillations are introduced at the inlet with two frequencies, namely the primary frequency of f1=160 Hz and the harmonic frequency of f2=320 Hz. The introduction of second harmonic frequency is found to change the heat release rate fluctuation significantly. With two frequency forcing, the amplitudes of heat release responses at the primary frequency are reduced significantly, up to 70% less than those with single frequency forcing. Also the phase values are reduced/increased a lot depending on the level of second harmonic forcing. At the same time, the heat release rate fluctuations are also reduced responding at the harmonic forcing except one case where both the forcing amplitudes of the two frequencies are small. The physical mechanisms are found to be highly related to the vortex flow structures during the acoustic forcing. The central recirculation region and the side recirculation region which generates the flame shear layers in between have different responses to the acoustic forcing depending on the frequencies and amplitudes. This work implies that LES, in this case via OpenFOAM, can be used to study the heat release responses and flame dynamics in complex cases of combustion instability, such as with two frequency forcing, with good accuracy. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd", , ,10.1016/j.fuel.2016.08.005,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84982843300&doi=10.1016%2fj.fuel.2016.08.005&partnerID=40&md5=3395c15bb53f05f81db9289d44a3583b,

The aim of studies of metagenomics is to determine the species present in an environmental community and identify changes in the abundance of species under different conditions. Current metagenomic analysis software faces bottlenecks due to the high computational load required to analyze complex samples. Results: A computational open-source workflow has been developed for the detailed analysis of metagenomes. This workflow provides new tools and datafile specifications that facilitate the identification of differences in abundance of reads assigned to taxa (mapping), enables the detection of reads of low-abundance bacteria (producing evidence of their presence), provides new concepts for filtering spurious matches, etc. Innovative visualization ideas for improved display of metagenomic diversity are also proposed to better understand how reads are mapped to taxa. Illustrative examples are provided based on the study of two collections of metagenomes from faecal microbial communities of adult female monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs concordant for leanness or obesity and their mothers.

We want to understand the characteristics of microservice workloads to design an infrastructure optimized for microservices. In this paper, we used Acme Air, an open-source benchmark for Web services, and analyzed the behavior of two versions of the benchmark, microservice and monolithic, for two widely used language runtimes, Node.js and Java. We observed a significant overhead due to the microservice architecture; the performance of the microservice version can be 79.2% lower than the monolithic version on the same hardware configuration. On Node.js, the microservice version consumed 4.22 times more time in the libraries of Node.js than the monolithic version to process one user request. On Java, the microservice version also consumed more time in the application server than the monolithic version. We explain these performance differences from both hardware and software perspectives.

Results: Through a user-centered design process, the authors created a software platform, the Tidepool Platform, to upload and host T1D device data in an integrated, device-agnostic fashion, as well as an application (""app""), Blip, to visualize the data. Tidepool's software utilizes the principles of modular components, modern web design including REST APIs and JavaScript, cloud computing, agile development methodology, and robust privacy and security. Discussion: By consolidating the currently scattered and siloed T1D device data ecosystem into one open platform, Tidepool can improve access to the data and enable new possibilities and efficiencies in T1D clinical care and research. The Tidepool Platform decouples diabetes apps from diabetes devices, allowing software developers to build innovative apps without requiring them to design a unique back-end (e.g., database and security) or unique ways of ingesting device data. It allows people with T1D to choose to use any preferred app regardless of which device(s) they use.

"Mother and children health reporting system: Innovative information system application in the rural West Bandung Area, Indonesia, by using multimodal communications systems","Faried A., Sutiono A.B., Djuwantono T., Arifin M.Z., Wirakusumah F.F., Yuniarto S.A., Hariyanto H., Jayadi Y.T.","Proceedings - 2015 4th International Conference on Instrumentation, Communications, Information Technology and Biomedical Engineering, ICICI-BME 2015",2016,202,207,,"Objectives: Digitalization of maternal and post-natal care system (DigiMAPS) is a system consist of electronic medical record for mother and children health (KIA) also for tele-consultation facility called Tele-Obgyn. Our project focuses on the development of KIA Online and a cloud computing-based video conferencing as a basis of Tele-Obgyn platform. The web-based network allows online access not only among primary health care but also between government and private institution. DigiMAPS platform is designed to meet the needs of database management and its interphase with other services that are responsible for data acquisition and visualization. Methods: DigiMAPS combines the open-source flexible system design that benefits for implementation and development needs as well as support for mobile devices to enable high quality of patient care. The system has been developed gradually following lean-innovation management concept which focuses on customer-problem-solution matching with rapid prototyping and validation from idea to solution. There was significant effort to establish a close relationship and learning process with prospective users of DigiMAPS, hence in the broader perspective we used a participatory research approach. DigiMAPS act as central-portal and -data base in the communication information system (ICT), designed to compile patient report paperless and equipped with tele-consultation. Results: DigiMAPS developed for a variety of administrative processes. This system will simplify the work process and can be integrated with primary health care system, Health Department and the Ministry of Health. A good ICT will be useful in collecting clinical information than conventional paper-based reporting system and to minimize errors in the reporting chain. Conclusions: By using lean innovation management, several inputs are gathered from prospective users including health authority, head of local clinics, midwifes, obgyn doctors, and public health staffs. Our system may bridging gap between clinical needs and digital documentation, telemedicine-monitoring and improve the quality of patient care, facilitate communication within both the scope of the internal (primary health care) and external (stakeholders and follow-up), increasing productivity and reduce overall expenses. © 2015 IEEE.", , ,10.1109/ICICI-BME.2015.7401299,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84963973937&doi=10.1109%2fICICI-BME.2015.7401299&partnerID=40&md5=61acdc388b6cd5bd4fd1994906eca7e2,

Arsonists or firefighters? Affectiveness in agile software development,"Ortu M., Destefanis G., Counsell S., Swift S., Tonelli R., Marchesi M.",Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing,2016,144,155,,"In this paper, we present an analysis of more than 500K comments from open-source repositories of software systems developed using agile methodologies. Our aim is to empirically determine how developers interact with each other under certain psychological conditions generated by politeness, sentiment and emotion expressed within developers’ comments. Developers involved in an open-source projects do not usually know each other; they mainly communicate through mailing lists, chat, and tools such as issue tracking systems. The way in which they communicate affects the development process and the productivity of the people involved in the project. We evaluated politeness, sentiment and emotions of comments posted by agile developers and studied the communication flow to understand how they interacted in the presence of impolite and negative comments (and vice versa). Our analysis shows that “firefighters” prevail. When in presence of impolite or negative comments, the probability of the next comment being impolite or negative is 13% and 25 %, respectively; ANGER however, has a probability of 40% of being followed by a further ANGER comment. The result could help managers take control the development phases of a system, since social aspects can seriously affect a developer’s productivity.

Extraction-based regression test selection,"Öqvist J., Hedin G., Magnusson B.",ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2016,,,,"Frequent regression testing is a core activity in agile software development, but large test suites can lead to long test running times, hampering agility. By safe RTS (Regression Test Selection) techniques, a subset of the tests can be identified that cover all tests that can change result since the last run. To pay off in practice, the RTS overhead must be low. Most existing RTS techniques are based on dynamic coverage analysis, making the overhead related to the tests run. We present Extraction-Based RTS, a new safe RTS technique which uses a fast static analysis with very low overhead, related to the size of the modification rather than to the tests run. The method is suitable for program-driven testing, commonly used in agile development, where each test is a piece of code that uses parts of the system under test.

How scrum tools may change your agile software development approach,"Eckhart M., Feiner J.",Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing,2016,17,36,,"A major problem for distributed Scrum teams is proper communication between the involved parties to ensure the quality of the final product. This is especially true for coordination issues such as sharing requirements, time schedules, to-dos and code artefacts. Hence, ScrumMasters complain frequently about software tools not suiting their daily needs when supporting agile teamwork, finally leading to the fact of not using a Scrum tool at all. In this paper we describe the extensive interviews held with selected ScrumMasters in which they explained their current tools and the existing gap to their real needs. Within this context, they were able to define the features and aspects they really need. After collecting those requirements for their daily work, we extracted the most wanted ingredients, prioritised them and finally forged them into an Open Source tool called Scrumpy, helping us to present a first solution, which focuses on the agile philosophy of Scrum and the elements needed most by ScrumMasters. Features of Scrumpy include, for example, web-based access to the task board with real-time updates, advanced dashboard visualisation techniques and a sophisticated chat system, which enables effortless communication for distributed teams. Although we already have first anecdotal feedback from users, we plan to improve the tool in a next step by adding more commodity features, perform additional mobile usability tests and systematically evaluate Scrumpy with a large number of end users. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.", , ,10.1007/978-3-319-27033-3_2,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84952683954&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-319-27033-3_2&partnerID=40&md5=6cd222f4b5be1d9ee870c9b09c648576,

Although social coding constitutes an important mechanisms of quality assurance and organizational learning in open source, little is known about its effects on co-located and ongoing professional software development teams. We close this gap by examining the question of how and why social coding affects professional development teams' work outcome and transactive memory. Results from our questionnaire-based survey with 61 development teams of more than 300 developers, team leads, and product managers, suggest that social coding not only improves teams' software quality directly but can also partially substitute for their transactive memory system.

Formalizing double groupoids and cross modules in the lean theorem prover,Von Raumer J.,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),2016,28,33,,"Lean is a new open source dependently typed theorem prover which is mainly being developed by Leonardo de Moura at Microsoft Research. It is suited to be used for proof irrelevant reasoning as well as for proof relevant formalizations of mathematics. In my talk, I will present my experiences doing a formalization project in Lean. One of the interesting aspects of homotopy type theory is the ability to perform synthetic homotopy theory on higher types. While for the first homotopy group the choice of a suitable algebraic structure to capture the homotopic information is obvious - it’s a group -, implementing a structure to capture the information about both the first and the second homotopy group (or groupoid) of a type and their interactions is more involved. Following Ronald Brown’s book on Nonabelian Algebraic Topology, I formalized two structures: Double groupoids with thin structures and crossed modules on groupoids.

In an earlier study, Bayesian UQ analysis was applied to existing bench-scale fluidized-bed gasifier experiment results. In the current study, a series of simulations were carried over with the open-source computational fluid dynamics software MFiX to reproduce the experimental conditions, where three operating factors, i.e., coal flow rate, coal particle diameter, and steam-to-oxygen ratio, were systematically varied to understand their effect on the syngas composition. Bayesian UQ analysis was this time performed on the numerical results for comparison purposes. This is part of ongoing research efforts to explore the applicability of advanced UQ methods and processes such as Bayesian methods for large-scale complex multiphase flow simulations. As part of Bayesian UQ analysis, a global sensitivity analysis was performed based on the simulation results, which shows that the predicted syngas composition is strongly affected not only by the steam-to-oxygen ratio (which was observed in experiments as well) but also by variation in the coal flow rate and particle diameter (which was not observed in experiments). The carbon monoxide mole fraction is underpredicted at lower steam-to-oxygen ratios and overpredicted at higher steam-tooxygen ratios. The opposite trend is observed for the carbon dioxide mole fraction. These discrepancies are attributed to either excessive segregation of the phases that leads to the fuel-rich or -lean regions or alternatively the selection of reaction models, where different reaction models and kinetics can lead to different syngas compositions throughout the gasifier. © 2016 American Chemical Society", , ,10.1021/acs.iecr.6b02506,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85013221145&doi=10.1021%2facs.iecr.6b02506&partnerID=40&md5=11978e3f4bdf14471ed6359dd2b10f94,

GPS and accelerometer time stamps: Proper data handling and avoiding pitfalls,Hurvitz P.M.,"Proceedings of the 1st International ACM SIGSPATIAL Workshop on Smart Cities and Urban Analytics, UrbanGIS 2015",2015,92,97,,"Introduction: Maintaining correct time stamp values is critical for management and analysis of time-indexed data, including GPS and accelerometry. Methods: Objective location and activity data were collected for one week periods in four projects, for 1551 subjects, using Qstarz BT1000 GPS data loggers and Actigraph GT3X accelerometers, in King County, WA. Data collection spanned September, 2011 to April, 2014, with analysis in May, 2014. GPS data were exported using QTravel and Actilife software, and processed under Windows XP and 7, using Microsoft Excel and Access, as well as two free and open-source applications, the R statistical programming environment and the database package, PostgreSQL. Results and conclusion: Time stamp errors resulted from the export of GPS data from QTravel and accelerometry data from Actilife for files spanning the Daylight Savings Time (DST) transition. QTravel has a specific problem in its interaction with Windows' default time zone settings. Excel and Access did not properly handle either time zone or DST, whereas both R and PostgreSQL did.

On rapid releases and software testing: a case study and a semi-systematic literature review,"Mäntylä M.V., Adams B., Khomh F., Engström E., Petersen K.",Empirical Software Engineering,2015,1384,1425,,"Large open and closed source organizations like Google, Facebook and Mozilla are migrating their products towards rapid releases. While this allows faster time-to-market and user feedback, it also implies less time for testing and bug fixing. Since initial research results indeed show that rapid releases fix proportionally less reported bugs than traditional releases, this paper investigates the changes in software testing effort after moving to rapid releases in the context of a case study on Mozilla Firefox, and performs a semi-systematic literature review. The case study analyzes the results of 312,502 execution runs of the 1,547 mostly manual system-level test cases of Mozilla Firefox from 2006 to 2012 (5 major traditional and 9 major rapid releases), and triangulates our findings with a Mozilla QA engineer. We find that rapid releases have a narrower test scope that enables a deeper investigation of the features and regressions with the highest risk. Furthermore, rapid releases make testing more continuous and have proportionally smaller spikes before the main release. However, rapid releases make it more difficult to build a large testing community , and they decrease test suite diversity and make testing more deadline oriented. In addition, our semi-systematic literature review presents the benefits, problems and enablers of rapid releases from 24 papers found using systematic search queries and a similar amount of papers found through other means. The literature review shows that rapid releases are a prevalent industrial practice that are utilized even in some highly critical domains of software engineering, and that rapid releases originated from several software development methodologies such as agile, open source, lean and internet-speed software development. However, empirical studies proving evidence of the claimed advantages and disadvantages of rapid releases are scarce. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.", , ,10.1007/s10664-014-9338-4,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84940719377&doi=10.1007%2fs10664-014-9338-4&partnerID=40&md5=1c1ee4066c600a8622cc168b563e5997, 
Predicting Release Time for Open Source Software Based on the Generalized Software Reliability Model,"Washizaki H., Honda K., Fukazawa Y.","Proceedings - 2015 Agile Conference, Agile 2015",2015,76,81,,"There is a significant challenge that how to predict the possible release date of the target software having enough reliability in agile development where incremental development and small software releases are key characteristics. Existing approaches targeting agile development usually use release backlogs for predicting and setting delivery windows, however these do not consider the reliability of software for release date prediction so that there is a possibility that software at the predicted release date have poor reliability. Previously we proposed a generalized software reliability model (GSRM) based on a stochastic process and compared it with other models to evaluate recent software developments. However, we, did not directly evaluate the accuracy of the predicted release time by model. In this paper, towards prediction of release dates in agile development, we focus on the release dates of open source software (OSS) developments and the number of detected issues (faults) since OSS developments comply well with the definition of the agile development in terms of incremental process and frequent releases We define the accuracy of the predicted release time using the given development terms and the number of issues. Additionally, we propose a method to evaluate the accuracy of the predicted release time. In the best case, GSRM shows only 0.572% Error Rate, which corresponds to a predicted release date of two days prior to the actual release date. We believe that our method should be applicable to agile developments too. © 2015 IEEE.", , ,10.1109/Agile.2015.19,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84962044997&doi=10.1109%2fAgile.2015.19&partnerID=40&md5=695a308121841797305b2ec2c2cad0b0,

Simulation of the flame describing function of a turbulent premixed flame using an open-source LES solver,"Han X., Morgans A.S.",Combustion and Flame,2015,1778,1792,,"Numerical simulations were used to characterise the non-linear response of a turbulent premixed flame to acoustic velocity fluctuations. The test flame simulated was the bluff body stabilised flame which has been the subject of a detailed experimental study (Balachandran et al., 2005). Simulations were performed using Large Eddy Simulation (LES) via the open source Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software, Code_. Saturne, with combustion modelled by combining a Flame Surface Density (FSD) method with a fractal approach for the wrinkling factor. The cold flow field and the unforced reacting flow were used for preliminary code validation. In order to characterise the non-linear response of the unsteady heat release rate to acoustic forcing, a harmonically varying velocity fluctuation, for which both the forcing frequency and normalised forcing amplitude were varied, was imposed. The flame response was characterised via a Flame Describing Function (FDF), also known as a non-linear flame transfer function, for which the gain and phase shift depend on forcing amplitude as well as forcing frequency. The response at four frequencies was compared to experimental data in detail, confirming that the LES results captured both the qualitative flame dynamics and the quantitative response of the heat release rate with very reasonable accuracy. The full FDF was then obtained across more frequencies, again showing a good fit with the experimental data, other than for a slight under-prediction in gain, most probably due to neglecting the effect of wall heat loss and the effect of combustion modelling. The agreement was significantly better than has been obtained previously for this test case using numerical simulations. Finally, it was found that increasing combustor length had little affect on the flame response, which may prove useful for future long combustor stability and limit cycle analysis. This work thus confirms that LES, in this case via the open source Code_. Saturne, provides a useful tool for characterising the response of lean premixed turbulent flames. © 2014 The Combustion Institute.", , ,10.1016/j.combustflame.2014.11.039,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84939988410&doi=10.1016%2fj.combustflame.2014.11.039&partnerID=40&md5=f9d6b90621245b9d049282d5284ef851, 
Test coverage and impact analysis for detecting refactoring faults: A study on the extract method refactoring,"Alves E.L.G., Massoni T., Machado P.D.L.",Proceedings of the ACM Symposium on Applied Computing,2015,1534,1540,,"Refactoring validation by automated testing is a common practice in agile development processes. However, this practice can be misleading when the test suite is not adequate. Particularly, refactoring faults can be tricky and difficult to detect. While coverage analysis is a standard practice to evaluate a test suite's fault detection capability, there is usually low correlation between coverage and fault detection. In this paper, we present an exploratory study on coverage of refactoring-impacted code, in order to identify shortcomings of test suites, focusing on the Extract Method Refactoring. We consider three open-source projects and their test suites. The results show that, in most cases, the lacking of test case calling the method changed in the refactoring increases the chance of missing faults. Also, a high proportion of test cases that do not cover the callers of that method does not reveal the fault either. Additional analysis of branch coverage on the test cases exercising impacted elements show a higher chance of detecting a fault when branch coverage is also high. It seems reasonable to conclude that a combination of impact analysis with branch coverage could be highly effective in detecting faults introduced by Extract Method.

A systematic mapping study on practical approaches to teaching software engineering,"Marques M.R., Quispe A., Ochoa S.F.","Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2015,,,,"Background: Software engineering is a core subject in computing education. Today, there seems to be a consensus that teaching software engineering requires students to perform practical experiences that simulate the work in the software industry. This represents a challenge for universities and instructors, because these experiences are complex to setup and involve considerable time and effort. Although there are several experiences and proposals reported in the literature, there is no clear solution to address this challenge. Aim: Being knowledgeable about the several approaches reported in the literature for dealing with this challenge is the first step to proposing a new solution. Counting on this knowledge allows instructors to reuse lessons learned from other universities. In order to address this challenge, we conducted a systematic mapping study that intends to answer the following questions: What are the main approaches used to address the practical experiences in software engineering education? Is there an emerging tendency to address this challenge? Which software process models are used to support the practical experiences in software engineering courses? Have the universities changed the way of conducting these experiences over the years? What are the main forums to seek information on practical approaches for teaching software engineering? Method: We used a systematic mapping study to identify and classify available research papers that report the use of practical experiences in software engineering education. Results: There were 173 papers selected, analyzed and classified. The results indicate that universities have realized the value of including practical experiences as part of the software engineering teaching process. However, few proposals indicate how to address that challenge. The practical approaches identified in this study were game learning, case studies, simulation, inverted classrooms, maintenance projects, service learning, and open source development. Only one recent report on the use of traditional approaches (i.e., teaching using expositive lectures) was found. The use of a development process to support these practical experiences seems not to be a concern for software engineering instructors. Only 40% of these studies report the use of a development process to guide the process experience. The reported processes are mainly agile methods. Conferences are the most used forum to publish studies in this area (72%). One third of these studies have been published over the last five years. Conclusion: There is a clear concern for teaching software engineering involving practical experiences, and there are several initiatives exploring how to do it. The map gives us an overview of the different proposals to address this challenge, and also allows us to make some preliminary conclusions about the preferred approaches. © 2014 IEEE.", , ,10.1109/FIE.2014.7044277,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84938152419&doi=10.1109%2fFIE.2014.7044277&partnerID=40&md5=058185d1cca4acf03e5fee262e7e14b9,

Impact of pair programming for effective software development process,"Prabu P., Duraisamy S.",International Journal of Applied Engineering Research,2015,18969,18986,,"Software development is a mentally complicated task. Different software development methodologies and quality assurance methods are used in order to attain high quality, reliable, and bug free software. eXtreme Programming (XP) is a software development discipline in the family of agile methodologies that contributes towards quality improvement using dozen practices.

The problems we faced were the lack of a centralized user management, insufficient scaling of our communication channels, and the necessity to adapt agile development techniques to remote collaboration. To solve the problems we decided to use a mix of open source tools (Git, IRC, LDAP) and commercial solutions (Jira, Confluence, GitHub) because we believe that this mix best fits our needs.

A test automation language framework for behavioral models,"Li N., Offutt J.","2015 IEEE 8th International Conference on Software Testing, Verification and Validation Workshops, ICSTW 2015 - Proceedings",2015,,,,"Model-based testers design tests in terms of models, such as paths in graphs. This results in abstract tests, which have to be converted to concrete tests because the abstract tests use names and events that exist in the model, but not the implementation. Model elements often appear in many abstract tests, so testers write the same redundant code many times. However, many existing model-based testing techniques are very complicated to use in practice, especially in agile software development. Thus, testers usually have to transform abstract tests to concrete tests by hand. This is time-consuming, laborintensive, and error-prone. This paper presents a language to automate the creation of mappings from abstract tests to concrete tests. Three issues are addressed: (1) creating mappings and generating test values, (2) transforming graphs and using coverage criteria to generate test paths, and (3) solving constraints and generating concrete tests. Based on the language, we developed a test automation language framework. The paper also presents results from an empirical comparison of testers using the framework with manual mapping on 11 open source and 6 example programs. We found that the automated test generation method took 29.6% of the time the manual method took on average, and the manual tests contained 48 errors in which concrete tests did not match their abstract tests while the automatic tests had zero errors. © 2015 IEEE.", , ,10.1109/ICSTW.2015.7107402,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84934344164&doi=10.1109%2fICSTW.2015.7107402&partnerID=40&md5=adf7adbf6c5ba85366058d88e7a33eb0,

Identifying functions in binary code with reverse extended control flow graphs,"Qiu J., Su X., Ma P.",Journal of Software: Evolution and Process,2015,793,820,,"In binary code analysis, current function identification approaches are challenged by functions without explicit call sites and handcrafted assembly without standard prologues/epilogues. We propose a new function representation called a reverse extended control flow graph (RECFG) and a RECFG-based method for identifying functions in stripped binary code. A function has at least one return instruction (an instruction that makes the control flow leave a function). Therefore, return instructions are more reliable than the function prologues and epilogues used by traditional methods. We first build RECFGs from any values that can be interpreted as return instructions in a code range. Then, for each independent RECFG, the multiple-decision method chooses a subgraph as the control flow graph of a function. A prototype tool is developed for evaluation on seven open source applications, 138 binaries in MASM32 code examples, and 292 binaries in Windows XP SP3.

The goal is to support both mathematical reasoning and reasoning about complex systems, and to verify claims in both domains.

The core parts of the Lean standard library have been developed constructively, but we also provide a smooth transition to classical logic. If users want to work classically, they just have to load the classical axioms and/or files built on them.

Conditional moment closure modelling for HCCI with temperature inhomogeneities,"Salehi F., Talei M., Hawkes E.R., Yoo C.S., Lucchini T., D'Errico G., Kook S.",Proceedings of the Combustion Institute,2015,3087,3095,,"This paper presents an approach for modelling combustion in homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) conditions based on the first order conditional moment closure (CMC) method. The model is implemented into the open source C++ computational fluid dynamic (CFD) code known as OpenFOAM. Direct numerical simulations (DNSs) are used to evaluate the performance of the CFD-CMC solver. In the two-dimensional (2D) DNS cases, ignition of a lean n-heptane/air mixture with thermal inhomogeneities is simulated for nine cases, with two different mean temperatures and several different levels of thermal stratification. Results from the CFD-CMC solver are in excellent agreement with the DNS for cases which exhibit a spontaneous sequential ignition mode of combustion whereas for the cases in which a mixed mode of deflagration and spontaneous ignition exists, the CMC underpredicts the ignition delay. Further investigation using the DNS data demonstrates that this discrepancy is primarily attributed to the first order closure assumption. Conditional fluctuations are found to be more significant in the case with deflagrations. Further analysis of the DNS shows that scalar dissipation fluctuations are the cause of conditional fluctuations. © 2014 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The experimental data has a rectangular test section at atmospheric pressure and 573 K with a single inlet jet. A jet velocity of 90 m/s is used with an adiabatic flame temperature of 2,064 K. Contours of major species, temperature and equivalence ratio along with their rms values are provided.

Numerical investigation of the thermo-acoustic influence of the Turbine on the combustor,"Farisco F., Panek L., Janus B., Kok J.B.W.",Proceedings of the ASME Turbo Expo,2015,,,,"Lean premixed combustion technology became state-of-the art in modern gas turbines for power generation to reduce NOx emissions. In these systems, thermo-acoustic oscillations are easily excited in the combustion chamber. Due to the high heat release density, extreme amplitudes can occur which reduce component life or may even cause damage to the engine. Knowledge of the acoustic behavior is required in order to understand and predict these instabilities. This study of the combustor turbine interaction is focused on the reflection coefficient analysis. The interface between the combustion system and the first turbine stage is the focus area of this study. The rotating components need to be included as outlook of this work. Compressible Large Eddy Simulation (LES) resolving acoustics is applied based on the open source CFD code OpenFOAM. Five cases of increasing complexity are presented. The main idea is to begin the study based on simple geometries such as a convergent divergent nozzle and two nozzles respectively convergent and divergent, to proceed with increased complexity by adding a vane section, and finally to investigate the behavior of a realistic tur-bine design. The real engine case consists of an authentic geometry including a can annular combustion chamber and turbine vane section. These cases are studied as basic generic tests in order to validate analytical formulae and to test the CFD methods applied. Calculations with acoustic excitation and non reflecting boundary conditions (NRBC) at the computational inlet and outlet domains are carried out to verify the plausibility of the acoustic set up. The forced response approach is applied provoking a wave excitation at the inlet of the combustion chamber. Multiharmonic excitation with small amplitudes is used to stay in the linear range. The post-processing for all cases is performed using the two-microphone method in order to calculate the reflection coefficient and the acoustic impedance taking into account the effects of the mean flow.

Test code quality and its relation to issue handling performance,"Athanasiou D., Nugroho A., Visser J., Zaidman A.",IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering,2014,1100,1125,,"Automated testing is a basic principle of agile development. Its benefits include early defect detection, defect causelocalization and removal of fear to apply changes to the code. Therefore, maintaining high quality test code is essential. This study introduces a model that assesses test code quality by combining source code metrics that reflect three main aspects of test codequality: completeness, effectiveness and maintainability. The model is inspired by the Software Quality Model of the SoftwareImprovement Group which aggregates source code metrics into quality ratings based on benchmarking. To validate the model we assess the relation between test code quality, as measured by the model, and issue handling performance. An experiment isconducted in which the test code quality model is applied to 18 open source systems. The test quality ratings are tested for correlation with issue handling indicators, which are obtained by mining issue repositories. In particular, we study the (1) defect resolution speed, (2) throughput and (3) productivity issue handling metrics.

Adapting SCRUM to the italian army: Methods and (open) tools,"Cotugno F.R., Messina A.",IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,2014,61,69,,"Many software-related technologies, including software development methodologies, quality models, etc. have been developed due to the huge software needs of the Department of Defense (DoD) of the United States.

The quality of many open source product has been demonstrated to be comparable to the close source ones and in many cases even higher and the effectiveness of agile approaches has been demonstrated in many industrial settings. Moreover, the availability of the source code makes open source products attractive for obvious reasons (e.g., security, long term maintenance, etc.). Following this trend, also the Italian Army has started using open source software and promotes its usage into the development processes of its contractors, also promoting agile approaches in many contexts focusing on the SCRUM methodology.

Another area of our CERN computing services that has required dedicated manual support has been clusters for specific user communities with special needs. Our aim is to move all our services to a layered approach, with server infrastructure running on the internal cloud computing infrastructure at CERN. This contribution illustrates how we plan to optimise the management of our of services by means of an end-user facing platform acting as a portal into all the related services for software projects, inspired by popular portals for open-source developments such as Sourceforge, GitHub and others.

This has been referred to as the 21st century paradox. As one solution to this problem, we propose to integrate entrepreneurship in the CIS curriculum. An analysis of N = 253 universities in the United States finds that only 39.5% offer both CIS and entrepreneurship degrees. Private universities and larger business schools were found to be more likely to offer both degrees than public universities or smaller business schools. A follow-up qualitative analysis of eight ABET accredited IS programs in business schools that also offer a full-time entrepreneurship degree finds that only one university gives students the option to take one entrepreneurship class as part of their IS major. We propose to infuse entrepreneurship in CIS classes based on the lean startup methodology and offer a learn-build-measure feedback loop, along with open source software and agile development practices, as a pedagogical framework for instructors.

To satisfy these demands, researchers employ flexible, agile software-based radio systems which efficiently use the resources available to them. Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) and cognitive radio are key concepts for achieving these research goals. This paper presents Spectrum Wars, a game designed to inform about DSA and cognitive radio but which has also proven to be an effective tool in educating about many of the basic principles of wireless telecommunications. The game pits two teams of players against each other to create and maintain wireless connections in a dynamic environment in order to transfer data as quickly as possible between a transmitter and receiver. Built upon Iris, an open-source framework for software radio, Spectrum Wars is freely available to be recreated, reused, expanded and improved.

Bayesian prediction of fault-proneness of agile-developed object-oriented system,"Li L., Leung H.",Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing,2014,209,225,,"Logistic regression (LR) and naïve Bayes (NB) extensively used for prediction of fault-proneness assume linear addition and independence that often cannot hold in practice. Hence, we propose a Bayesian network (BN) model with incorporation of data mining techniques as an integrative approach. Compared with LR and NB, BN provides a flexible modeling framework, thus avoiding the corresponding assumptions. Using the static metrics such as Chidamber and Kemerer’s (C-K) suite and complexity as predictors, the differences in performance between LR, NB and BN models were examined for fault-proneness prediction at the class level in continual releases (five versions) of Rhino, an open-source implementation of JavaScript, developed using the agile process. By cross validation and independent test of continual versions, we conclude that the proposed BN can achieve a better prediction than LR and NB for the agile software due to its flexible modeling framework and incorporation of multiple sophisticated learning algorithms. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.", , ,10.1007/978-3-319-09492-2_13,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84927765420&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-319-09492-2_13&partnerID=40&md5=a3457a18477dccfa898899a05753fa5f,

The control platform is distinguished by flexible pheriphals implemented in a FPGA which also contain a converter model for real-time simulation during control and software development. The converter model simulation facilitates continous integration during control software development. Python is the language used in the framework for C++ template code- and header-generation for modules. The framework include a Matlab/Simulink wrapper so dedicated control modules can be developed and tested using a bottom-up approach in the Simulink environment.

Speed Up the Conception of Logical Systems with Test-Driven Development,Vidal M.,"Journal of Logic, Language and Information",2014,83,103,,"In this paper, I stress the utility of employing test-driven development (TDD) for conceiving logical systems. TDD, originally invented in the context of Extreme Programming, is a methodology widely used by software engineers to conceive and develop programs. Its main principle is to design the tests of the expected properties of the system before the development phase. I argue that this methodology is especially convenient in conceiving applied logics. Indeed, this technique is efficient with most decidable logics having a software implementation. Having a clear list of the desired inferences right from the beginning makes it possible to refine the properties of the system step by step until its completion. I distinguish and detail seven advantages of the usage of TDD for the conception of a logical theory. Most importantly, this methodology increases the predictability of the inferential power of the theory. A second important benefit is that the time required for the conception of the logic goes down dramatically. This methodology will change both ideas and practices. Logic is no longer considered to be a formal science, but rather to be an empirical one. Research in the field is geared toward specific and concrete goals. Programs are considered tools used to verify the conformity of formal theories. To sum up, I defend the view that, in some situations, this way of designing a formal system brings significant benefits, and that the construction of new logics can be conducted similarly to the development of open source software. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.", , ,10.1007/s10849-013-9180-x,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84900403942&doi=10.1007%2fs10849-013-9180-x&partnerID=40&md5=c1ee5255988e3c12f78c9f4fbc4fbd1f,

Transport equations are solved for the Navier-Stokes system and the controlling variables. The detailed chemistry code Chem1D is used to create the manifolds. Turbulence can be modeled using a PDF approach for the subgrid modeling of the chemistry terms. The OpenFOAM open source CFD package is used as CFD tool for the simulations. The aim of this work is to demonstrate the usage of FGM with OpenFOAM and figure out the status of the implementation. To achieve this goal, the work employs as test case a confined lean jet flame is used. For the case presented, an extensive experimental data set exist, including PIV and Raman data. Results are further compared with traditional methods, while FGM method might be easily extended to other scenarios.

"Modeling an enclosed, turbulent reacting methane jet with the premixed conditional moment closure method","Martin S., Jemcov A., De Ruijter B.",Proceedings of the ASME Turbo Expo,2013,,,,"Here the premixed Conditional Moment Closure (CMC) method is used to model the recent PIV and Raman turbulent, enclosed reacting methane jet data from DLR Stuttgart [1]. The experimental data has a rectangular test section at atmospheric pressure and temperature with a single inlet jet. A jet velocity of 90 m/s is used with an adiabatic flame temperature of 2, 064 K. Contours of major species, temperature and velocities along with velocity rms values are provided. The conditional moment closure model has been shown to provide the capability to model turbulent, premixed methane flames with detailed chemistry and reasonable runtimes [2]. The simplified CMC model used here falls into the class of table lookup turbulent combustion models where the chemical kinetics are solved offline over a range of conditions and stored in a table that is accessed by the CFD code. Most table lookup models are based on the laminar 1-D flamelet equations, which assume the small scale turbulence does not affect the reaction rates, only the large scale turbulence has an effect on the reaction rates. The CMC model is derived from first principles to account for the effects of small scale turbulence on the reaction rates, as well as the effects of the large scale mixing, making it more versatile than other models. This is accomplished by conditioning the scalars with the reaction progress variable. By conditioning the scalars and accounting for the small scale mixing, the effects of turbulent fluctuations of the temperature on the reaction rates are more accurately modeled. The scalar dissipation is used to account for the effects of the small scale mixing on the reaction rates. The original premixed CMC model used a constant value of scalar dissipation, here the scalar dissipation is conditioned by the reaction progress variable. The steady RANS 3-D version of the open source CFD code OpenFOAM is used. Velocity, temperature and species are compared to the experimental data. Once validated, this CFD turbulent combustion model will have great utility for designing lean premixed gas turbine combustors.

A skeletal mechanism for the reactive flow simulation of methane combustion,"Karalus M.F., Fackler K.B., Novosselov I.V., Kramlich J.C., Malte P.C.",Proceedings of the ASME Turbo Expo,2013,,,,"A skeletal mechanism for the prediction of NOx emissions from methane combustion at gas turbine conditions is developed in the present work. The goal is a mechanism that can be used in computational fluid dynamic modeling of lean premixed (LPM) combustors. A database of solutions from 0-D, adiabatic, homogeneous reactors (PSRs) is computed using CHEMKIN-PRO [1] over a parameter space chosen to include pressures from 1 to 30 arm, equivalence ratios from 0.4 to 1.0, and mean PSR residence times from slightly greater than blowout to 3ms. A resisidence time of 3 ms represents a useful maximum for the super-equilibrium flame zone where most of the NOx forms in LPM combustors. Fuel oxidation and NOx formation are treated separately in the reduction process. The method of Directed Relation Graph (DRG) is applied for methane oxidation and its extension, DRG-aided sensitivity analysis (DRGASA), is used to determine the skeletal NOx mechanism to append to the methane mechanism. Post-processing of the PSR solution database and implementation of the reduction algorithm are accomplished in SAGE [2], a Python based, open-source mathematics software package. The skeletal oxidation and NO x mechanisms are validated against full GRI 3.0 [3] in both PSR and laminar flame speed calculations. When compared with the detailed GRI 3.0 mechanism, NOx emissions are predicted within 7% near blowout and 3% at 3 ms, and laminar flame speeds are predicted within 20% over the range of equivalence ratios and pressures. The skeletal mechanism is presented here and it should be noted that all reactions of the H2/CO submechanism are retained. The skeletal mechanism consists of 22 species and 122 reactions for methane oxidation and an additional 8 species and 55 reactions to describe NOx formation (30 species, 177 reactions total). The final skeletal mechanism with NOx chemistry is available for download here [4]. To demonstrate the predictive capability of the validated mechanism in a reactive flow system, it is implemented in an ANSYS Fluent model of a single jet stirred reactor, the results of which are compared to experimental reactor data presented in [5] and [6]. Predicted and measured profiles of temperature and NOx emissions are shown. Temperature and NOx emissions compare well in the recirculation zone of the JSR, although both NOx emissions and temperature are under-predicted in the jet region. Finally, the contribution of each chemical pathway for NOx formation is evaluated.

Towards the establishment of an agile method for OERs development and delivery,"Arimoto M.M., Barbosa E.F.","Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",2013,541,547,,"Open Educational Resources (OERs) have been emerged as an important mechanism for democratization of access to education. In fact, the free and open distribution of these resources contributes with the dissemination of knowledge and facilitates the access to information, benefiting the society as a whole. Similar to software, the development of OERs requires the application of appropriate methods and practices to ensure the productivity and quality of the resulting products. Agile methods seem to be an interesting approach in this perspective. However, initiatives to foster the development and delivery of quality and reliable OERs, according to agile principles and with reduced costs, are still incipient. In our work we discuss the establishment of an agile method for the development and delivery of OERs. The proposed method is based on the main characteristics, practices and principles of well-known agile methods for software.

For information systems development, we propose to extend this feedback loop by using database profiling information to propose adaptations to the conceptual model to improve performance.

The proposed model optimisations are based on common database and data model refactoring patterns.

This paper presents an analysis of the level of implementation and the evolution of numerous commercial and open-source EHR systems in use today. We began the review by searching Medline terms such as EHR, 'commercial electronic health records', 'open-source electronic health records'. We also looked in non-peer-reviewed literature by searching different search engines. Moreover, we identified providers and users from the different solutions and contacted them to obtain more information. The most important international barrier to the adoption of EHR systems is economic resources. The wealthiest countries opt to implement their own EHR systems. The commercial applications that currently have the greatest number of registered users are eclinicalworks, CareTracker and Allscripts Professional, all belonging to U.S. companies. The most commonly used open-source systems are HOSxp, OpenEMR and OpenVistA. The first two are implemented, in general, on the African continent, Latin America and some countries in Asia. The implementation of an international and interoperable EHR platform is difficult to achieve because each country has a different level of development of these systems.

Predicting fault-proneness of object-oriented system developed with agile process using learned bayesian network,"Li L., Leung H.",ICEIS 2013 - Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Enterprise Information Systems,2013,5,16,,"In the prediction of fault-proneness in object-oriented (OO) systems, it is essential to have a good prediction method and a set of informative predictive factors. Although logistic regression (LR) and naïve Bayes (NB) have been used successfully for prediction of fault-proneness, they have some shortcomings. In this paper, we proposed the Bayesian network (BN) with data mining techniques as a predictive model. Based on the Chidamber and Kemerer's (C-K) metric suite and the cyclomatic complexity metrics, we examine the difference in the performance of LR, NB and BN models for the fault-proneness prediction at the class level in continual releases (five versions) of Rhino, an open-source implementation of JavaScript written in Java.

In either case, it is very useful to determine what refactorings have recently taken place in order to comprehend better the software and its development trajectory. To this end, we have developed an approach to automate the detection of source code refactorings using structural information extracted from the source code. Our approach takes as input a list of possible refactorings, a set of structural metrics and the initial and revised versions of the source code. It generates as output a sequence of detected changes expressed as refactorings. This refactoring sequence is determined by a search-based process that minimizes the metrics variation between the revised version of the software and the version yielded by the application of the refactoring sequence to the initial version of the software. We use both global and local heuristic search algorithms to explore the space of possible solutions.

Numerical analysis of the acoustic and flow field associated with perforated liners with variable acoustic forcing,"Andreini A., Bianchini C., Facchini B., Vitale I., Turrini F.",19th AIAA/CEAS Aeroacoustics Conference,2013,152,,,"Effusion cooled liners, such as those implemented in Avio lean combustion systems based on PERM (Partially Evaporated and Rapid Mixing) injectors, showed the potential for optimal designs combining high thermal efficiency and good capabilities of reducing the propagation of pressure fluctuations due to thermoacoustic instabilities. Despite several attempts conducted in recent years to quantitatively model the acoustic absorption of perforate plates, little is known on the phenomena driving the dissipation of acoustic energy especially in the non-linear regime where the influence of the forcing amplitude is not negligible. The aim of this paper is to numerically verify the behaviour of perforated screens with bias flow subjected to acoustic forcing with variable pressure fluctuation level. The absorption properties of the plates in realistic conditions for combustor liner cooling are investigated together with the mutual interactions between the aerodynamic and acoustic field. Large Eddy Simulations exploiting the open-source CFD code OpenFOAM are performed implementing the same set up already proposed and validated for previous acoustic analysis focused on the linear regime only. Acoustic forcing is provided by means of non-reflecting boundary conditions following the NSCBC approach with sinusoidal reference pressure oscillations. 1D pressure waves propagating concordant and discordant with the bias flow are reconstructed with the multi-microphone technique. A single orifice configuration with cyclic boundary is used to mimic an infinite perforation pattern saving computational resources. The onset of non-linear regime is investigated for two different type of holes, an orthogonal and a slanted (30 deg) drilling, on two levels of bias flow corresponding to Mab=0.05 and 0.1. Same level of acoustic forcing, ranging between 117 to 160 dB, was applied to both the high and low bias flow condition highlighting the effect of bias flow on non-linear regime triggering. Obtained results showed how, despite a large influence of acoustic fluctuations on the aerodynamic, the absorption coefficient is insensitive to the acoustic forcing unless flow reversal limit is outreached.", , ,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84883677173&partnerID=40&md5=7f821e0b2bf461420523d57fd711fc3a,

Novel open-source electronic medical records system for palliative care in low-resource settings,"Shah K.G., Slough T.L., Yeh P.T., Gombwa S., Kiromera A., Oden Z.M., Richards-Kortum R.R.",BMC Palliative Care,2013,,,,"Abstract. Background: The need for palliative care in sub-Saharan Africa is staggering: this region shoulders over 67% of the global burden of HIV/AIDS and cancer. However, provisions for these essential services remain limited and poorly integrated with national health systems in most nations. Moreover, the evidence base for palliative care in the region remains scarce. This study chronicles the development and evaluation of DataPall, an open-source electronic medical records system that can be used to track patients, manage data, and generate reports for palliative care providers in these settings. DataPall was developed using design criteria encompassing both functional and technical objectives articulated by hospital leaders and palliative care staff at a leading palliative care center in Malawi. The database can be used with computers that run Windows XP SP 2 or newer, and does not require an internet connection for use. Subsequent to its development and implementation in two hospitals, DataPall was tested among both trained and untrained hospital staff populations on the basis of its usability with comparison to existing paper records systems as well as on the speed at which users could perform basic database functions. Additionally, all participants evaluated this program on a standard system usability scale. Results: In a study of health professionals in a Malawian hospital, DataPall enabled palliative care providers to find patients' appointments, on average, in less than half the time required to locate the same record in current paper records. Moreover, participants generated customizable reports documenting patient records and comprehensive reports on providers' activities with little training necessary. Participants affirmed this ease of use on the system usability scale. Conclusions: DataPall is a simple, effective electronic medical records system that can assist in developing an evidence base of clinical data for palliative care in low resource settings. The system is available at no cost, is specifically designed to chronicle care in the region, and is catered to meet the technical needs and user specifications of such facilities. © 2013 Shah et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.", , ,10.1186/1472-684X-12-31,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84882794245&doi=10.1186%2f1472-684X-12-31&partnerID=40&md5=fcb193d75d95949f2d225cca8026917e,

From cluster to cloud to appliance,Malan D.J.,"Annual Conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education, ITiCSE",2013,88,92,,"We propose a client-side virtual machine (VM) as an alternative to on-campus clusters and off-campus clouds as a development environment for students in introductory courses. In Fall 2011, we deployed the CS50 Appliance, our own such VM, to 600 students on campus and, in Fall 2012, to 700 students on campus and 140,000 students online. We present in this work the results of that two-year experiment. The appliance itself is available as open source for others to adapt or adopt. Not only did the appliance enable us to provide students with simpler tools, among them a graphical editor without any latency, it also enabled us to provide more sophisticated tools too, including a web server and database server. Moreover, the appliance ensured that the course's workload no longer required constant Internet access, particularly of students abroad. And the appliance alleviated load on the course's servers, with execution of students' programs now distributed across students' own CPUs. Without the appliance (or more costly clusters or clouds), we certainly could not have accommodated as many as 140,000 students. But some students' laptops, particularly netbooks, struggled under the appliance's weight. Even though designed to be lean, the appliance, like any VM, still consumes resources, particularly RAM.

Regarding OSS in clinical applications, mainly case studies from hospital-wide IS have been reported. Agile methods have been examined merely in the context of healthcare software product development. However, the development of web-based applications in clinical departments using agile methods and OSS has not been studied so far. Thus, in this paper the feasibility of such an approach is examined for an electronic case report form (eCRF) application for orthopaedical studies.

Major functional and structural changes were needed to meet clinical requirements. We present the process applied to fulfill these requirements, and selected features that may be applied in the translational phase of other image-guided surgical navigation systems. METHODS: We used an agile software development process for rapid adaptation to unforeseen clinical requests. The process is based on iterations of operating room test sessions, feedback discussions, and software development sprints. The open-source application framework of 3D Slicer and the NA-MIC kit provided sufficient flexibility and stable software foundations for this work. RESULTS: All requirements were addressed in a process with 19 operating room test iterations. Most features developed in this phase were related to workflow simplification and operator feedback. CONCLUSION: Efficient and affordable modifications were facilitated by an open source application framework and frequent clinical feedback sessions.

This paper will compare the fit between an Open Source Electronic Medical Record Solution (OpenMRS) and a clinical guideline that outlines the requirements for the care of a patient. Design/methodology: A process analysis technique is used to construct and analyse the fit between the processes as stipulated by the South African clinical guidelines for Tuberculosis (TB) and that of the OpenMRS. This technique has been used to identify inefficiencies and opportunities. Lean principles are applied in the analysis to identify waste in the process. Findings: Process analysis has provided valuable insight into the working of both the system and the provision of this healthcare service. The OpenMRS solution has a good fit to the South African healthcare context with some minor gaps between the system processes and that of the clinical guidelines.

Heat transfer in shear-driven thin liquid film flows,"Marati J.R., Budakli M., Gambaryan-Roisman T., Stephan P.",Computational Thermal Sciences,2013,303,315,,"The objective of the study is to investigate the hydrodynamics and heat transfer in a shear-driven liquid film flow. This process is relevant to fuel flow inside lean pre-mixed pre-vaporization chambers. A combined numerical and experimental study has been performed to determine the heat transfer in gas-driven thin liquid films on the outer surface of vertical heated tubes. Numerical simulations have been performed using the volume of fluid method implemented in the open-source computational fluid dynamics code OpenFOAM for turbulent air/water flow conditions. The code has been extended for simulation of two-phase flows with heat transfer. The Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations with the k - ε turbulence model for gas-liquid two-phase flows have been solved using the finite-volume method. The results on the wall temperature distribution and average film thickness have been compared with the experimental data. A reasonable agreement between the simulations and experiment has been found. The results indicate that the heat transfer is enhanced with increasing gas Reynolds number due to the film thinning and intensification of convection. © 2013 by Begell House, Inc.", , ,10.1615/ComputThermalScien.2013006073,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84877651415&doi=10.1615%2fComputThermalScien.2013006073&partnerID=40&md5=c249f2909ea7c7314529118fbdb6978f,

A case study of software process improvement with CMMI-DEV and Scrum in Spanish companies,"Garzás J., Paulk M.C.",Journal of software: Evolution and Process,2013,1325,1333,,"One of the most commonly used agile methods is Scrum. Capability Maturity Model Integration for Development (CMMI-DEV) is currently the de facto framework for process improvement and for determining the organizational maturity of software development companies. CMMI-DEV and Scrum share certain characteristics, and even though they were developed for different purposes, they can be complementary to each other; and as such, they are not in competition. This paper presents a case study of the relationship between level 2 of CMMI-DEV 1.3 and Scrum. This research has focused on the relationships between Scrum and level 2 of CMMI-DEV 1.3. The objective of this research paper is to evaluate how Scrum helps implement a process model such as CMMI-DEV. A detailed case study was conducted among Spanish IT companies. The case study was designed according to established guidelines for cases studies. There were eight principal activities: case study design, case selection, case study procedures and roles, data collection, analysis, plan validity, study limitations, and reporting. The results obtained show that most of the process areas of CMMI-DEV level 2 had been improved by using Scrum. Other issues detected arose during the formal appraisals and illustrated how it is possible to verify with Scrum that the specific goals of CMMI-DEV have been implemented. In addition, it highlights how the use of open-source tools was useful in improving the process in the companies involved.

N-pentanol is a five carbon, straight-chain alcohol, which can be produced through natural microbial fermentation and/or engineered microorganisms. It has many advantages over lower carbon alcohols, including higher energy density, lower vapor pressure and better fuel compatibility. In this study, a detailed reaction mechanism of n-pentanol, on the basis of a previously proposed n-butanol mechanism, is generated using the open-source software Reaction Mechanism Generator (RMG). High temperature chemistry of the mechanism was validated against recently published laminar flame speeds and ignition delays. Encouraging results between simulations and experiments were observed under most conditions. Simulations were also conducted using a recently developed n-pentanol oxidation mechanism (NUI model) by Heufer et al. For lean mixtures, the two mechanisms show similar results, while the RMG model yields better predictions for rich mixtures and at an elevated pressure.

But there are upfront and ongoing efforts and risks attached to the adoption of OTS components which makes decision-making very difficult. Such difficulties are for example a large and intransparent market, incompatibilities between components and architectural mismatches. In this paper, a plan towards a novel platform concept is proposed that can improve the situation for software engineers coping with the adoption of OTS components during web-based systems development. One key contribution is an empirically derived ontology to describe software artifacts on a feature level allowing a better description and identification of OTS components in the domain of web development.

Modular multiple sensors information management for computer-integrated surgery,"Vaccarella A., Enquobahrie A., Ferrigno G., Momi E.D.",International Journal of Medical Robotics and Computer Assisted Surgery,2012,253,260,,"Background: In the past 20years, technological advancements have modified the concept of modern operating rooms (ORs) with the introduction of computer-integrated surgery (CIS) systems, which promise to enhance the outcomes, safety and standardization of surgical procedures. With CIS, different types of sensor (mainly position-sensing devices, force sensors and intra-operative imaging devices) are widely used. Recently, the need for a combined use of different sensors raised issues related to synchronization and spatial consistency of data from different sources of information. Methods: In this study, we propose a centralized, multi-sensor management software architecture for a distributed CIS system, which addresses sensor information consistency in both space and time. The software was developed as a data server module in a client-server architecture, using two open-source software libraries: Image-Guided Surgery Toolkit (IGSTK) and OpenCV. The ROBOCAST project (FP7 ICT 215190), which aims at integrating robotic and navigation devices and technologies in order to improve the outcome of the surgical intervention, was used as the benchmark. An experimental protocol was designed in order to prove the feasibility of a centralized module for data acquisition and to test the application latency when dealing with optical and electromagnetic tracking systems and ultrasound (US) imaging devices. Results: Our results show that a centralized approach is suitable for minimizing synchronization errors; latency in the client-server communication was estimated to be 2ms (median value) for tracking systems and 40ms (median value) for US images. Conclusion: The proposed centralized approach proved to be adequate for neurosurgery requirements. Latency introduced by the proposed architecture does not affect tracking system performance in terms of frame rate and limits US images frame rate at 25 fps, which is acceptable for providing visual feedback to the surgeon in the OR. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.", , ,10.1002/rcs.1412,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84865401190&doi=10.1002%2frcs.1412&partnerID=40&md5=685f862efdcc1ac365140dc59507bb24,

A more cost-effective unattended ground sensor using commercial off-the-shelf products,"Hempenius K.A., Wilson R.A., Kumar M.J., Hosseini N., Cordovez M.E., Sherriff M.S.","2012 IEEE Systems and Information Engineering Design Symposium, SIEDS 2012",2012,62,67,,"The military is increasingly using sensors as part of its battlefield strategy. Sensors can be used as an alternative to placing soldiers in dangerous situations and the information that sensors collect helps leaders make better decisions. However, the cost of integrating these sensors into existing tactical networks has been a limiting factor in their adoption. Thus, the research team sought to use Android smartphones and Arduino microcontrollers, two commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) technologies, to create an inexpensive, ""plug-and-play"" interface to help relieve this issue. This interface was then demonstrated through the creation of a series of unattended ground vehicles (UGVs) that can be networked together in an ad-hoc wireless mesh network to collect sensor data from across an operational area. This project was broken down into two phases and the Agile development methodology was used throughout. During the first phase an interface between the Android phone and Arduino microcontroller was created and then integrated with sensors. During the second phase a robotics platform, path setting algorithm, and the ad-hoc wireless mesh network were developed. Collectively, this project demonstrated the feasibility of using open-source, commercially available parts to create unattended ground sensor (UGS) networks, thereby providing an alternative to current market offerings which are custom and proprietary in nature and therefore expensive and difficult to upgrade. © 2012 IEEE.", , ,10.1109/SIEDS.2012.6215148,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84863687009&doi=10.1109%2fSIEDS.2012.6215148&partnerID=40&md5=75c68ca39da173dc0d4131e662c0bc92, 
AN OPEN SOURCE GEOVISUAL ANALYTICS TOOLBOX for MULTIVARIATE SPATIO-TEMPORAL DATA in ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE MODELLING,"Bernasocchi M., Coltekin A., Gruber S.","ISPRS Annals of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences",2012,123,128,,"In environmental change studies, often multiple variables are measured or modelled, and temporal information is essential for the task. These multivariate geographic time-series datasets are often big and difficult to analyse. While many established methods such as PCP (parallel coordinate plots), STC (space-time cubes), scatter-plots and multiple (linked) visualisations help provide more information, we observe that most of the common geovisual analytics suits do not include three-dimensional (3D) visualisations. However, in many environmental studies, we hypothesize that the addition of 3D terrain visualisations along with appropriate data plots and two-dimensional views can help improve the analysts' ability to interpret the spatial relevance better. To test our ideas, we conceptualize, develop, implement and evaluate a geovisual analytics toolbox in a user-centred manner. The conceptualization of the tool is based on concrete user needs that have been identified and collected during informal brainstorming sessions and in a structured focus group session prior to the development. The design process, therefore, is based on a combination of user-centred design with a requirement analysis and agile development. Based on the findings from this phase, the toolbox was designed to have a modular structure and was built on open source geographic information systems (GIS) program Quantum GIS (QGIS), thus benefiting from existing GIS functionality. The modules include a globe view for 3D terrain visualisation (OSGEarth), a scattergram, a time vs. value plot, and a 3D helix visualisation as well as the possibility to view the raw data. The visualisation frame allows real-time linking of these representations. After the design and development stage, a case study was created featuring data from Zermatt valley and the toolbox was evaluated based on expert interviews. Analysts performed multiple spatial and temporal tasks with the case study using the toolbox. The expert interviews were helpful to gain initial insight into the usability of the tools and to highlight further improvements and challenges; revealing certain usability issues and indicating that analysts consider the linked views to be potentially very beneficial and they appreciate seeing the data in its spatial context.", , ,10.5194/isprsannals-I-2-123-2012,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84952765777&doi=10.5194%2fisprsannals-I-2-123-2012&partnerID=40&md5=51b507f2986114d131ab39672828c37d, 
Enhancing tool support for situational engineering of agile methodologies in eclipse,"Shakeri Hossein Abad Z., Alipour A., Ramsin R.",Studies in Computational Intelligence,2012,141,152,,"In recent years, with the growth of software engineering, agile software development methodologies have also grown substantially, replacing plan-driven approaches in many areas. Although prominent agile methodologies are in wide use today, there is no method which is suitable for all situations. It has therefore become essential to apply Situational Method Engineering (SME) approaches to produce agile methodologies that are tailored to fit specific software development situations. Since SME is a complex process, and there is a vast pool of techniques, practices, activities, and processes available for composing agile methodologies, tool support-in the form of Computer Aided Method Engineering (CAME) environments-has become essential. Despite the importance of tool support for developing agile methodologies, available CAME environments do not fully support all the steps of method construction, and the need remains for a comprehensive environment. The Eclipse Process Framework Composer (EPFC) is an open-source situational method engineering tool platform, which provides an extensible platform for assembly-based method engineering in Eclipse. EPFC is fully extensible through provision of facilities for adding new method plug-ins, method packages, and libraries. The authors propose a plug-in for EPFC which enables method engineers to construct agile methodologies through an assembly-based SME approach. The plug-in provides facilities for the specification of the characteristics of a given project, selection of suitable agile process components from the method repository, and the final assembly of the selected method chunks, while providing a set of guidelines throughout the assembly process. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.", , ,10.1007/978-3-642-30460-6_10,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84863000338&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-642-30460-6_10&partnerID=40&md5=b2743f3c464f4f3a4bac9401c6282695, 
Reconciling software development models: A quasi-systematic review,"Magdaleno A.M., Werner C.M.L., Araujo R.M.D.",Journal of Systems and Software,2012,351,369,,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to characterize reconciliation among the plan-driven, agile, and free/open source software models of software development. Design/methodology/approach: An automated quasi-systematic review identified 42 papers, which were then analyzed. Findings: The main findings are: there exist distinct - organization, group and process - levels of reconciliation; few studies deal with reconciliation among the three models of development; a significant amount of work addresses reconciliation between plan-driven and agile development; several large organizations (such as Microsoft, Motorola, and Philips) are interested in trying to combine these models; and reconciliation among software development models is still an open issue, since it is an emerging area and research on most proposals is at an early stage. Research limitations: Automated searches may not capture relevant papers in publications that are not indexed. Other data sources not amenable to execution of the protocol were not used. Data extraction was performed by only one researcher, which may increase the risk of threats to internal validity. Implications: This characterization is important for practitioners wanting to be current with the state of research. This review will also assist the scientific community working with software development processes to build a common understanding of the challenges that must be faced, and to identify areas where research is lacking. Finally, the results will be useful to software industry that is calling for solutions in this area. Originality/value: There is no other systematic review on this subject, and reconciliation among software development models is an emerging area. This study helps to identify and consolidate the work done so far and to guide future research.

We compare the first two approaches with OSSD, highlighting its synthesis of benefits from both, with unique benefits of its own, offering solutions to areas where the other methodologies continue to face difficulties. OSSD is highly responsive to user needs, and potentially draws talent from a global team of developers. OSSD is a relatively low-risk methodology with potentially high return on investment.

An empirical assessment of refactoring impact on software quality using a hierarchical quality model,"Shatnawi R., Li W.",International Journal of Software Engineering and its Applications,2011,127,150,,"Software refactoring is a collection of reengineering activities that aims to improve software quality. Refactorings are commonly used in agile software processes to improve software quality after a significant software development or evolution. There is belief that refactoring improves quality factors such as understandability, flexibility, and reusability. However, there is limited empirical evidence to support such assumptions. The aim of this study is to confirm such claims using a hierarchal quality model. We study the effect of software refactoring on software quality. We provide details of our findings as heuristics that can help software developers make more informed decisions about what refactorings to perform in regard to improve a particular quality factor. We validate the proposed heuristics in an empirical setting on two open-source systems. We found that the majority of refactoring heuristics do improve quality; however some heuristics do not have a positive impact on all software quality factors. In addition, we found that the impact analysis of refactorings divides software measures into two categories: high and low impacted measures. These categories help in the endeavor to know the best measures that can be used to identify refactoring candidates. We validated our findings on two open-source systems-Eclipse and Struts.

Assessment of numerical tools for the evaluation of the acoustic impedance of multi-perforated plates,"Andreini A., Bianchini C., Facchini B., Simonetti F., Peschiulli A.",Proceedings of the ASME Turbo Expo,2011,1065,1077,,"Multi-perforated liners, commonly employed in Gas Turbine combustors as cooling devices to control metal temperature, are recognized as very effective sound absorbers. Thus, in the innovative lean combustion technology, where the onset of thermoacoustic instabilities represents one of the most important issue, the multi-perforated plates can be exploited both for wall cooling and damping combustion instabilities. As a first step of a large experimental and numerical research program regarding multi-perforated liners, an investigation of different numerical methodologies to analyze acoustic damping is here reported. In particular three different numerical techniques to evaluate planar waves sound absorption of perforated plates are presented and validated with literature test cases. A quasi 1-D code, implementing the wall compliance concept, provides results for a large set of geometric and fluidynamic conditions. A large test matrix was investigated varying perforation hole angle and diameter with different overall porosities. The effect of bias and grazing flows Mach number was tested as well. A subset of considered geometries were then supported by a full reconstruction of the unsteady pressure field by means of a Large Eddy Simulation computed with an open-source code. Non-reflective boundaries with forcing term provide the wave to acoustically excite the perforated plate.

XtalOpt version r7: An open-source evolutionary algorithm for crystal structure prediction,"Lonie D.C., Zurek E.",Computer Physics Communications,2011,2305,2306,,"A new version of XtalOpt, a user-friendly GPL-licensed evolutionary algorithm for crystal structure prediction, is available for download from the CPC library or the XtalOpt website, http://xtalopt.openmolecules.net. The new version now supports four external geometry optimization codes (VASP, GULP, PWSCF, and CASTEP), as well as three queuing systems: PBS, SGE, SLURM, and ""Local"". The local queuing system allows the geometry optimizations to be performed on the users workstation if an external computational cluster is unavailable. Support for the Windows operating system has been added, and a Windows installer is provided. Numerous bugfixes and feature enhancements have been made in the new release as well. New version program summary: Program title: XtalOpt Catalogue identifier: AEGX-v2-0 Program summary URL: http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/AEGX-v2-0.html Program obtainable from: CPC Program Library, Queens University, Belfast, N. Ireland Licensing provisions: GPL v2.1 or later [1] No. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 125 383 No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 11 607 415 Distribution format: tar.gz Programming language: C++ Computer: PCs, workstations, or clusters Operating system: Linux, MS Windows Classification: 7.7 External routines: Qt [2], Open Babel [3], Avogadro [4], and one of: VASP [5], PWSCF [6], GULP [7], CASTEP [8] Catalogue identifier of previous version: AEGX-v1-0 Journal reference of previous version: Comput. Phys. Comm. 182 (2011) 372 Does the new version supersede the previous version?: Yes Nature of problem: Predicting the crystal structure of a system from its stoichiometry alone remains a grand challenge in computational materials science, chemistry, and physics. Solution method: Evolutionary algorithms are stochastic search techniques which use concepts from biological evolution in order to locate the global minimum of a crystalline structure on its potential energy surface. Our evolutionary algorithm, XtalOpt, is freely available for use and collaboration under the GNU Public License. See the original publication on XtalOpts implementation [11] for more information on the method. Reasons for new version: Since XtalOpts initial release in June 2010, support for additional optimizers, queuing systems, and an operating system has been added. XtalOpt can now use VASP, GULP, PWSCF, or CASTEP to perform local geometry optimizations. The queue submission code has been rewritten, and now supports running any of the above codes on ssh-accessible computer clusters that use the Portable Batch System (PBS), Sun Grid Engine (SGE), or SLURM queuing systems for managing the optimization jobs. Alternatively, geometry optimizations may be performed on the users workstation using the new internal ""Local"" queuing system if high performance computing resources are unavailable. XtalOpt has been built and tested on the Microsoft Windows operating system (XP or later) in addition to Linux, and a Windows installer is provided. The installer includes a development version of Avogadro that contains expanded crystallography support [12] that is not available in the mainline Avogadro releases. Other notable new developments include: LIBSSH [10] is distributed with the XtalOpt sources and used for communication with the remote clusters, eliminating the previous requirement to set up public-key authentication;Plotting enthalpy (or energy) vs. structure number in the plot tab will trace out the history of the most stable structure as the search progresses A read-only mode has been added to allow inspection of previous searches through the user interface without connecting to a cluster or submitting new jobs;The tutorial [13] has been rewritten to reflect the changes to the interface and the newly supported codes. Expanded sections on optimizations schemes and save/resume have been added;The included version of SPGLIB has been updated. An option has been added to set the Cartesian tolerance of the space group detection. A new option has been added to the Progress tables right-click menu that copies the selected structures POSCAR formatted representation to the clipboard;Numerous other small bugfixes/enhancements.

Agile methods for open source safety-critical software,"Gary K., Enquobahrie A., Ibanez L., Cheng P., Yaniv Z., Cleary K., Kokoori S., Muffih B., Heidenreich J.",Software - Practice and Experience,2011,945,962,,"The introduction of software technology in a life-dependent environment requires the development team to execute a process that ensures a high level of software reliability and correctness. Despite their popularity, agile methods are generally assumed to be inappropriate as a process family in these environments due to their lack of emphasis on documentation, traceability, and other formal techniques. Agile methods, notably Scrum, favor empirical process control, or small constant adjustments in a tight feedback loop. This paper challenges the assumption that agile methods are inappropriate for safety-critical software development. Agile methods are flexible enough to encourage the right amount of ceremony; therefore if safety-critical systems require greater emphasis on activities, such as formal specification and requirements management, then an agile process will include these as necessary activities. Furthermore, agile methods focus more on continuous process management and code-level quality than classic software engineering process models. We present our experiences on the image-guided surgical toolkit (IGSTK) project as a backdrop. IGSTK is an open source software project employing agile practices since 2004. We started with the assumption that a lighter process is better, focused on evolving code, and only adding process elements as the need arose. IGSTK has been adopted by teaching hospitals and research labs, and used for clinical trials. Agile methods have matured since the academic community suggested almost a decade ago that they were not suitable for safety-critical systems; we present our experiences as a case study for renewing the discussion. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.", , ,10.1002/spe.1075,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79960129411&doi=10.1002%2fspe.1075&partnerID=40&md5=e802be2fd3e092f534930669fef7824d,

Comput. Appl. Eng. Educ., 2008, in press). Using Java Native Interfacing, it was shown that STEVE 1.0 could wrap a space-time stochastic model written in any computer language and be independent of any specific language compiler during tool usage. This article describes the general philosophy, software design, and classroom usage for STEVE with significant improvements on visualization and user-friendliness (hence, rightfully called version 2.0). The software was created using the C++ programming language with the Microsoft Windows Applications Programming Interface (API). OpenGL was used for the visualization display, and the OpenGL Utility Toolkit (GLUT) was used to visualize text inside the OpenGL window. The instructor-specified simulation program on stochastic theory was written in Fortran 77. The application has user-friendly options for modifying input data and parameter specifications as desired by the instructor or the student user.

A note on risks in software development with imperfect testing,Bagchi T.P.,OPSEARCH,2011,65,72,,"This study analytically assesses the statistical risk of releasing defective software that cannot be exhaustively tested, and of needlessly testing defect-free software. Specifically, it quantifies the probability of committing Type I (α) and Type II errors (β) in software development when one may release software that still is faulty or do needless testing since the test methods themselves may not be perfect. The study uses Truncated-Poisson and geometric distributed path lengths and Bernoulli-type inspection errors to link ? and β to software design features, the development philosophies employed, and certain aspects that include code quality, cyclomatic complexity and the average length of basis paths. For risk reduction this study finds quantitative justification for raising test coverage, perfecting the test methods, the adoption of recent innovations and programming methods such as component-based design, SOA and XP as ways to raise the likelihood that the product developed will be fault free.

Aside from the pure code development that is nowadays well supported by integrated development environments (IDEs) such as Eclipse, also other activities receive increasing attention in the matter of tool support. Recent improvements in tool support for source code management (SCM), process management and documentation management are driven by the changing demands of increasing distribution and agility of development projects. Moreover, the integration of tool support systems into integrated project management environments (IPMEs) increase the usefulness of each emerging tool support, especially for agile approaches. The Petri net-based agent-oriented software engineering (Paose) is highly influenced by agile methods and combines the agile concepts with aspects from model driven development. We have achieved increased efficiency by the adoption of IPMEs into the Paose development approach.

Moreover, the quantitative comparison across groups of gels is based on simple classical tests that often do not fully account for the experimental design. We developed software with a graphical user interface, RegStatGel, which implements a novel statistical algorithm for identifying differentially expressed proteins. Unlike current commercial software packages, it is free, open-source, easy to use and almost fully automated. It also provides more advanced statistical tools. More importantly, by using a master watershed map, RegStatGel bypasses the spot-matching procedure, which is a time-consuming bottleneck in gel image analysis. The software is freely available for academic use and has been tested in Matlab 7.01 under Windows XP. Detailed instructions on how to use RegStatGel to analyze 2D gel images are provided. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.", , ,10.1016/B978-0-12-381270-4.00021-4,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-78650884354&doi=10.1016%2fB978-0-12-381270-4.00021-4&partnerID=40&md5=65e4bb75a228e6e4a59ca18154de384a,
